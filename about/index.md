Check out my [now page]({% link about/now.md %}) if you are curious about what I'm focusing on now. See my [secure]({% link about/secure.md %}) page for information on how to communicate with me through secure methods.

Let me introduce myself. I'm 45 and am married to my amazing wife Tammy. We have two fabulous kids, Mazie and Tyler. I love being a Dad. It's the best thing ever. We have a dog named Chase who thinks he is a lap dog in a black lab body.

I really like to explore new things. The result of that is that I have too many hobbies. I would consider myself an amateur photographer. I'm a fairly avid blogger at thingelstad.com where I write about whatever I feel like. I am fanatical about the [Big Green Egg](http://biggreenegg.com/). I am a lucky member of the [R/W Book Club]({% link about/bookclub.html %}). I'm a supporter of the open web and support Wikipedia, Creative Commons, Archive.org and the EFF.

I've been a [CTO](http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2007/07/the_different_cto_roles.html) for a long time. I've learned a lot about serving big, mission critical applications on a global scale. I was the founding CTO for [BigCharts](http://www.bigcharts.com/). We were bought by [MarketWatch](http://www.marketwatch.com/) and I was CTO there while we did some awesome stuff. Then MarketWatch was bought by [Dow Jones](http://www.dowjones.com/) where I also then had a CTO role. A lot of changes, all without moving offices. Now I'm CTO for [SPS Commerce](http://spscommerce.com/). I am also a board member at [Minnestar](http://minnestar.org/), the organization that runs [Minnebar](http://minnestar.org/minnebar/) and [Minnedemo](http://minnestar.org/minnedemo/).
