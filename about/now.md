I'm in Minneapolis, MN. What I'm currently focused on.

  * Being a present and engaged father for my daughter (11) and son (7) as well as a loving husband for my wife.
  * Succeeding in continual transformation and growth of the [SPS Commerce](http://www.spscommerce.com) technology team and platform.
  * Building traditions with family and friends at our new cabin.
  * Building a habit of journaling every day with [Day One](http://dayoneapp.com).
  * Reconnecting with photography to give my creative dimension cycles.
  * Giving back to the local technology community through my volunteer engagement with [minnestar](http://minnestar.org).
  * Reading books that expand my understanding and appreciation of a variety of topics with my friends in R/W Book Club.
  * I'm focused on deep understanding and productivity with using GTD and [OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/).

*This page inspired by [Derek Sivers' /now page movement](https://sivers.org/nowff), also see [NowNowNow](http://nownownow.com).*
