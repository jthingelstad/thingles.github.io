title: Fun Facts

In addition to my [bio]({% link about/bio/index.md %}) here are some fun facts. You may also find my [now page]({% link about/now.md %}) interesting.

## Professional

* I’m a focused practitioner of the [Getting Things Done](http://gettingthingsdone.com) methodology and am focused on it as a lifelong skill to continually improve my personal productivity but even more importantly to give me the mental space and clarity to focus on what I want to focus on at any time.

## Personal

* I’m an amateur photographer and continue to explore a variety of photography types using both mobile and DSLR cameras. Selected phots are on my [photography website](https://photos.thingelstad.com).
* I once created a fun travel game about identifying mathematical relationships in the numbers that appear on road signs, called Road Sign Math!
* I’m more Star Trek than Star Wars, and more R.E.M. than U2. But confusingly I’m more Coldplay than Radiohead so that’s confusing. I’m generally a very big music fan and enjoy nearly all genres.

## Techie

* I once created a wiki to track thousands of global wikis and store the number of users, pages, edit and files over time. It tracks the extensions used and is the most comprehensive data system of the wiki ecosystem. The project, called [WikiApiary](https://wikiapiary.com/wiki/Main_Page), is still being run by people in the MediaWiki team.
* I publish a [weekly newsletter called the Weekly Thing](https://weekly.thingelstad.com), playing on my last name. It's a mix of "things" that I'm reading, interesting links, trend-watching, my amateur photography, app recommendations, etc.
* I’ve been an active blogger since 2004. I’ve been microblogging via Twitter and my own sites since 2006. My link blog goes back to 2005. I think about the Internet and our use of it over decades and am focused on preserving the personal and non-commercial parts of the Internet as well as the corporate and governmental parts. I’m a long-time supporter of the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org), [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org) and [Internet Archive](https://archive.org) as well as other organizations that work on this.
* I’m a board member of [Minnestar](https://minnestar.org) and work hard to support the Twin Cities technology ecosystem. I’ve been to every [Minnebar](https://minnestar.org/minnebar/) event and have presented at many of them.
