![200px-wall_street.jpg]({{ site.url }}/assets/posts/2007/wall_street1.jpg)There are a few movies that I'm particularly geeky about. "[Apocalypse Now](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078788/)" rates at the top of my favorites, and I've seen it an embarrasing number of times. "[Glengarry Glen Ross](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104348/)" is there too, and an annual viewing is nearly required. Along with these great movies is "Wall Street", so I was delighted to see this article in the New York Times discussing the sequel to "[Wall Street](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094291/)", to be titled "Money Never Sleeps" (not to be confused with "[Money Never Sleeps -- Making of Wall Street](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0373159/)") ([read full article](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/05/movies/05movi.html?ex=1336104000&en=272eabdfd88ba95f&ei=5124&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink)).
Another Wall Street? Yes! As [my friend](http://www.tersteeg.org/) said, "GG returns!". Can't wait for this to hit the theaters!
