I'm totally obsessed with my [Wii](http://wii.nintendo.com/) all over again and it's because of [Guitar Hero](http://www.guitarhero.com/) III - Legends of Rock. In between [attempts to update my Wii software](/thingelstad/nintendo-wii-servers-overloaded), I've been rocking out with Guitar Hero III. I can't remember the last time I played a single game for over an hour -- until now.

This is a seriously fun game. Think of [Dance Dance Revolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_Dance_Revolution), but without a silly dance pad and way better music. Oh, and I can actually play [Guitar Hero](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_hero), unlike DDR. It comes with a plastic "guitar controller" that you mount the Wiimote in and you start playing away. I was hooked pretty much instantly. It's a _must have Wii game_, particularly for the air guitar sort.

If you are playing Guitar Hero already [connect with my profile](http://www.guitarhero.com/accounts/352472) and let's shred!
