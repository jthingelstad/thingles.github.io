![ny-mets-3d-logo.jpg](/assets/posts/2007/ny-mets-3d-logo1.jpg)Last Wednesday night [Jim](http://www.jimbernard.net/) and I decided to go see a [Mets](http://newyork.mets.mlb.com/) game while in NY for business. We took a long train ride on the 7 out to Shea Stadium and picked up some tickets. We got some absolutely great tickets off of the 3rd base side. This was my second time at Shea, and oddly both times they were playing Atlanta. It was a lot of fun to see the game with Jim who knows more about baseball than I could ever know. He filled me in on some great trivia about the Mets that made me enjoy the game even more.

It was a great night. The game was awesome, with the Mets holding off the Braves for the win. The Mets fans are simply the best. These people express every range of human emotion, amplified to 11, through the course of a single game. Top it off with a wonderful evening outside, even though it was hotter and more humid than any of us would have liked. Baseball is meant to be played in that type of venue. As Jim said, "we could be watching a herd of goats grazing and it would still be great". You bet! It will be great when the Twins get their new stadium.

Now I just have to figure out how to get to a Yankees game!
