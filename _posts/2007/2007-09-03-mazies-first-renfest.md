And just to keep things really interesting, we brought Izzy along as well. It was awesome. Everyone had a great time. Mazie really enjoyed it and had fun with just everything going on. Izzy did well, and was very interested when she realized there were bones laying around.
I put up a [few photos](/photos/album/72157601820457298/Renaissance-Festival.html) and here is a quick video from our day...
