[![linked-cover.jpg]({{ site.url }}/assets/posts/2007/linked-cover1.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0738206679/?tag={{ site.affiliate.amazon }})The subtitle of this book is enough to garner intrigue -- "How everything is connected to everything else, and what it means". Wow! That's a pretty big proclamation. I discovered [Linked](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0738206679/?tag={{ site.affiliate.amazon }}) via an email from a former colleague who said she had read it and found it very interesting. This is a woman who is not prone to hyperbole, and when I got an email that made references to "neobiological" and the emergence of a new form of life from the Internet, I just had to know more.
Linked lives up to the expectation. Linked is all about networks. I don't mean networks filled with ethernet cables and WiFi routers. Rather this is the study of logical networks that exist everywhere. The analysis of network theory, particularly the [scale-free network](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale-free_networks) model that the author creates, is all immensely interesting. I found the application of certain laws to scale-free networks most interesting. All scale-free networks must follow them. This becomes more interesting upon understanding that the Internet, the Web, our circle of friends and even the inner-workings of a human cell all follow the model of a scale-free network.

Prior to [Barabasi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert-Laszlo_Barabasi)'s work, network theory was dominated by random network models created by [Erdős](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Erdős) and Renyi. These random networks were mathematically interesting, and led to some worthwhile discoveries, but the problem is that very little in the real world follows a random network model.

Linked is a great book for provoking thought. While reading it I couldn't help but consider all of the various networks that I am a node in. My head started to spin visualizing these multi-dimensional networks with connected nodes, behaving like wormholes in string theory.

More and more we are surrounded by, and participating in networks. The blogosphere is a scale-free network. [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/) is a scale-free network. Technology is extending the reach, and power, of these networks exponentially. It is worth us understanding the implications, and how to better leverage, these networks. I have no idea where this will all head, but after reading Linked I think I'll be better equipped to understand it.
