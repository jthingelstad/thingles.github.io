[![180px-moneyballsbn.jpg]({{ site.url }}/assets/posts/2007/180px-moneyballsbn1.jpg)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneyball)I just finished reading [Moneyball](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneyball). This book was recommended to me by a [friend](http://www.jimbernard.net/) who really likes baseball and feels that it's very odd that I don't like baseball. You see, I love numbers. I love patterns. I love graphs. And according to Moneyball, baseball is all about numbers.
Moneyball was a really enjoyable book, and it succeeded in making me appreciate baseball a lot more and I will definitely enjoy the games even more. However, after reading it the main thing I was left with was how backwards the baseball establishment has been for so long. You mean that statistical analysis may help you determine how a player will perform? Wow. Stunning stuff.

The way Lewis writes this book makes it sound like there is a strict set of two camps. One that plays by look and feel, the other that plays by spreadsheets. I'm sure it's not that simple, but it makes for a wonderful story and is very well written.

If you like numbers, and have much of any interest in baseball, you should take a read through Moneyball.
