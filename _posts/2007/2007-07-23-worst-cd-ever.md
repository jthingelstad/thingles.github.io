[![92.jpg](/assets/posts/{{ page.date | date: "%Y" }}/921.jpg)](http://thingelstad.com/s/worst-cd-ever/92jpg/img)I recently went through the process of reviewing my rather large CD collection and culling out things that I really don't like. Accidental purchases or things that I just didn't like after trying it.
When we were on a roadtrip a number of years ago we decided to pick up a few CD's just to try some things. [Only In America, Volume 2](http://www.arfarfrecords.com/arfarf/records/aa92.html) from [Arf! Arf! Records](http://www.arfarfrecords.com/arfarf/home.html) was one of those CD's. It seemed like it was just a collection of quirky music. I now think it is perhaps the worst CD ever made. I challenge anyone reading this to try to listen to every track on it from start to finish. An excerpt from the web site promoting it:

<blockquote>_Only in America _ focuses on material that leaves the listener bewildered and in utter disbelief.

Amazingly this is Volume 2. There is a [Volume 1](http://www.arfarfrecords.com/arfarf/records/aa49.html) as well that I hope to never hear even a track of.

Update: There is a great post and dialog going on about this album [over at JasonHare.com](http://jasonhare.com/2006/09/18/this-suckstry-this-only-in-america-volume-2/).
