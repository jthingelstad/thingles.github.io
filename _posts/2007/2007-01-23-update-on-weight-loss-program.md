It's been about five weeks now since [I posted about Traineo](http://thingelstad.com/s/fitness/traineo/img). I really started in earnest on my weight loss program a couple of weeks before that. I am happy to report that I'm feeling strong and have made a lot of progress.

I reached a high of 315 lbs (note, that isn't a lifetime record, that was set at 332 a long time ago) and I've since lost 21 pounds off of that high. Most importantly I've been feeling good about exercising and eating healthy. I'm using the [Traineo](http://www.traineo.com/) service to help keep me in line and work with my motivators ([him](http://www.thetangens.net/), [him](http://www.jimbernard.net/), her and [my trainer at the gym](http://www.myselectfitness.com/)). I've been able to do this without getting completely obsessive about it as well -- which is a huge step for me. Over the last two years I've only done really good when logging every morsel of food that passes my lips. This just isn't sustainable, and I think ultimately reinforces bad behaviors.

I'm finding myself in a bit of a lull right now. I'm feeling great that I've lost over 20 pounds thus far and even more importantly I'm able to run for reasonable periods again, can do a decent job on my spin bike and am feeling my strength returning. However, I'm also feeling the challenge of so much more to go just to get to my current goal of 250 lbs. It's a long road back to the mountaintop that I was sitting easily on a few years ago.

However, such is the reality of it all and the job that needs to be done. I don't put the myriad of updates on my training program here on this site. I think it would overwhelm the rest of the content. If you would like to keep up with how I'm doing, stop by my Traineo page and check out my progress.
