![fingerprint.gif]({{ site.url }}{% link /assets/posts/2007/fingerprint1.gif %})If you are reading thingelstad.com via the RSS feed you will notice that I have added a <strike>copyright notice</strike> [creative commons](http://creativecommons.org/) license to the feed, along with a digital fingerprint and for fun the IP address of the machine that pulled in your RSS feed. I'm doing this to fight back against website hijacking.

I'm noticing a lot of my content being stolen via my RSS feed and then republished on spammer websites. This is a slimy practice and is a growing trend.[ Lorelle wrote on this at some length recently](http://thingelstad.com/s/2006/04/10/what-do-you-do-when-someone-steals-your-content/img). I decided to do something about it with the [(C)Feed](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/copyfeed/) WordPress plug-in.

I went out of my way to just put the <strike>copyright notice</strike> creative commons license in a regular HTML block at the end of the post. I decided to post about this to encourage others to consider adding this if their content is being stolen, and to let you know why the <strike>copyright notice</strike> creative commons license has appeared.
