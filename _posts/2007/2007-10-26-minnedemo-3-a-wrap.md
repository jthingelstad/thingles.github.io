Does anyone know where the reference to [Mo'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mo) started? Like, we got our mo' in the second half. Our products really selling, we've got mo'. Hiring is a breeze because we have mo'! If your not following here mo' is momentum. After leaving [Minnedemo](http://www.minnedemo.com/) 3 a couple weeks ago, it was clear that the Minneapolis technology community is building mo'.

I'm a bit late in writing about Minnedemo 2. [Graeme Thickens](http://graemethickins.typepad.com/graeme_blogs_here/) did a [thorough job in his post](http://graemethickins.typepad.com/graeme_blogs_here/2007/10/minnedemo---hot.html). Minnedemo continued it's template of 15-minute demo's from a variety of people working on interesting things. Notable this time was the [CrashPlan](http://www.crashplan.com/) demo from Matthew Dornquast at Code42. I've seen CrashPlan several times and have followed it's progression from the sidelines. The product has really expanded and I think that Code42's recent additions focused on businesses (using the E word, enterprises) is really smart and smartly built. [Fanchatter](http://fanchatter.com/) also had a cool demo, although I'd tweak the product here and there. I don't think they are going to hit that uber-viral point as is. There were also demos from [SOTAcomm](http://sotacomm.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=18&Itemid=35), [Wonderfile](http://www.wonderfile.net/), [Pokeware](http://www.pokeware.com/) and [Adaptive Avenue](http://www.adaptiveavenue.com/). I missed much of the last half chatting with people I ran into at Minnedemo.

There were approximately 300 people at Minnedemo and it was great to see so many familiar faces. Having at [O'Garas Garage](http://www.ogaras.com/garagecalendar.html) was great to accommodate the size of the crowd, but people need to be a bit more polite to the speakers. Shhhh...

I was surprised to hear an announcement of a Christmas Edition (December 6th! Mark your calendar!) of Minnedemo coming in just a couple of months. Yeah! See you all there!
