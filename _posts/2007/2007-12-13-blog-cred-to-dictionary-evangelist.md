![chipper_icon.jpg](/assets/posts/{{ page.date | date: "%Y" }}/chipper-icon1.jpg)My RSS reader is filled with a lot of technology stuff, a variety of Apple websites and a ton of friends that have blogs. I recently subscribed to a new blog that I had to create a new group for. The group is called _Interesting_, and the blog is [Dictionary Evangelist](http://www.dictionaryevangelist.com/).
I got exposed to this blog by watching Erin McKean's presentation at [TED](http://www.ted.com/) entitled "[Redefining the Dictionary](http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/161)" via their podcasts. The video was fun, and her posts are "interesting" and fun as well. Erin is a [lexicographer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographer), which is to say she makes dictionaries. Cred' out to [Dictionary Evangelist](http://www.dictionaryevangelist.com/) ([Add Feed](http://www.dictionaryevangelist.com//atom.xml)).

What's in your "Interesting" group?
