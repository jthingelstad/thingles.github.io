I've been thinking for a while about upgrading my small, travel-friendly camera. I've had a [Canon S500 for nearly three years](/thingelstad/canon-powershot-s500). It is/was a great camera, and [amazingly rugged](/thingelstad/fiasco).Â  But, it was a litle too heavy, and not small enough to slip into your shirt pocket so it wasn't great for fun, light pictures on the go. On my [recent trip to NY](/thingelstad/stranded-in-new-york) I got an hour of free time and headed over to [B&H Photo and Video](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/) on 9th Avenue. I wanted to see the store that I had ordered so much from online, and it was a gadget geeks dream. If you like camera stuff, you must go.
I checked out a dozen of the Canon small cameras and decided to go ahead with the Canon SD750. It is only a month old, and has an amazing form factor. It's about the size of my Blackberry 8800, just a couple of millimeters thicker. Pretty crazy. I seriously considered the Canon SD800IS because I really wanted optical image stabilization, but I didn't like the older form factor.

The startup time for the camera is good. Not like my Canon 20D, but that's to be expected. It is ready to shoot in a second. The real "wow" happens when you look at the back though.

The screen on the SD750 is just _massive_. It's only 3" in size, but it seems just enormous. You can read a [detailed review](http://www.dpreview.com/news/0702/07022202canonsd750sd1000.asp) if you are curious, but there are some really nice convenience features on this camera that I'm loving.



  * Support for a travel timezone so you can flip your clock around much easier.


  * When you are looking at photos, the orientation sensor is used to show you the photo in the right orientation. Nice touch.


  * The D-pad control is almost touch sensitive. It's hard to explain, but a nice effect in the UI.

The pictures I've taken so far are great. The only thing I really miss is that it doesn't support Canon RAW, so I've got JPEG files back into my workflow. Oh well. It's a great camera.
