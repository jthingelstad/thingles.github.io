Tammy and I had a great time last night at the [Butterball](http://www.thebutterballparty.com/)! Through the generosity of my friend [Dan Grigsby](http://www.unpossible.com/), Tammy and I as well as the [Tangen's](http://www.thetangens.net/) got on [our best Black & White](http://thingelstad.com/s/photos/album/72157603230568692/photo/2045018403/Butterball-2007-20071117-201113-3231jpg.html) and headed out for a night of fun. The evening was packed. The Butterball sold out and raised a nice amount to help get food to those who need it.

The evening began with a silent auction. There were probably 50 items up for auction with a great variety of things. We put our name on a number of items and after surveying the area a bit decided to get serious about the live art. There was an artist on the stage who was doing a painting right there while everyone mingled. The artist was [Chris Allen](http://www.inkproof.com/) and he was doing a Graffiti piece. I really liked it for a bunch of different reasons so we focused on that and happily when 9:30 arrived we were the highest bidder. Great art, and for a great cause.

This is the piece that we got before framing and in really horrible light.

We ran into so many people that we knew at the Butterball. It made a fun evening even more enjoyable! After the auction ended [Soul Asylum](http://www.soulasylum.com/) [took the stage](http://thingelstad.com/s/photos/album/72157603230568692/photo/2045019617/Butterball-2007-20071117-221047-3272jpg.html) and put on a really amazing show!

I haven't listened to much Soul Asylum for a while now and it was really fun to hear some of the great songs. The energy was great -- really a fun show.

After a few hours of mingling and having a great time, we headed home in the chaos of Saturday night frenzy in downtown.
