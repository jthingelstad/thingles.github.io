[![gorillapodslr_camera.jpg]({{ site.url }}/assets/posts/2007/gorillapodslr_camera1.jpg)](http://www.joby.com/products/gorillapod/)Time for "Take 2" of my drive to work time elapased video!
I really liked the first take at this, but the camera was mounted very poorly. Think tape combined with a rear-view mirror and you get the idea. It was swinging around and shaking with abandon, which caused a ridiculous video. I was looking at getting a [Gorillapod](http://www.joby.com/products/gorillapod/) for my trip to Canada in a couple of weeks and it was also the perfect tripod to mount a camera on my dash. This, combined with an overcast day that gave more even light and a closer position to the windshield to eliminate a lot of the grime on the glass made for a significantly better video.

For comparison, here is the first one as well. Try hitting play on both of these at the same time to see the differences.
