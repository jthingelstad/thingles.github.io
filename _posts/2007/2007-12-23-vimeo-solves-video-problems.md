![vimeo.jpg]({{ site.url }}{% link /assets/posts/2007/vimeo1.jpg %})I have been searching for a good video hosting service for a while. Something that solves my online video problems like [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/) solves my online photo problems. At first blush you probably think this is silly, [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/) is the obvious answer. Well, not really.
After a while searching I found [Vimeo](http://www.vimeo.com/) and have been delighted. My first test for video hosting services was to upload the [13 minute fishing video from Canada]{% link _posts/2007/2007-11-18-chipai-fishing-trip-video.md %}. YouTube denies this video because it is over 10 minutes long. [Google Video](http://video.google.com/) couldn't transcode it to Flash after several attempts. Sadly even the [.Mac](http://www.mac.com/WebObjects/Welcome) video hosting couldn't reliably receive the upload from iMovie (sad). Vimeo on the other hand took it with ease and got it transcoded on the first try.

I'm very happy with the quality of video from Vimeo. You get privacy controls if you want them. Embedding it in your blog is simple and easy. Plus you aren't surrounded by trashy videos like on YouTube. I'm happy to finally find a place to plant video.

Over the course of the next few weeks I'm going to migrate anything from YouTube to Vimeo. While doing it I'll likely recut some of the video that looks a bit rough.
