Spring is here, and along with it is the 2nd annual [Minnebar](http://barcamp.org/MinneBar) "unconference". Reserve the date now and block out **April 21st** on your calendar. Yes it's a Saturday, and it's going to be a nice day in early spring, but it's a great time and you'll learn a lot and meet some great people. Go to [the site](http://barcamp.org/MinneBar) and sign up on the wikipage now.

If you are curious, Minnebar is the close relative of [Minnedemo](http://barcamp.org/MinneDemo). Minnedemo is focused on demo's and occurs twice a year, just for an evening. The most recent one was the [Holiday Minnedemo](/thingelstad/holiday-minnedemo). Minnebar is a complete conference and is focused on topics, taking a full day.
