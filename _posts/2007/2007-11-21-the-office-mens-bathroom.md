At our office we have a long running joke about the men's bathroom. By long running I mean several years. There is always something wrong. Flooding. Broken knobs and handles. Atomic flushing. I'll leave it at the pleasantries. A couple weeks ago I walked in and saw a nice note on the door to one of the stalls.

The sign on the door reads

_STOP USING HAND TOWELS TO WIPE YOUR ARSE. THEY DON'T FLUSH!!!_

Really, it's a privilege to work with people that can throw out an "arse".
