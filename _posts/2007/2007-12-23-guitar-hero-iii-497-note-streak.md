I'm [still having a blast on Guitar Hero III](/thingelstad/guitar-hero-iii-rocks-the-wii). I played for a while yesterday trying to clear some levels before the big Christmas Day extravaganza with my brother-in-laws where I expect much GH3 action. While playing I saw the notice for a 200 note streak pop up and freaked out. I knew I was hitting the song, but when it was all over...

497 note streak! That is on the medium difficulty in the 4th "level". Unfortunately the [Guitar Hero site](http://www.guitarhero.com/) doesn't rank streaks so I have no idea how big of a number that is, but I thought it was pretty impressive! Check out [my profile page](http://www.guitarhero.com/accounts/profile/352472) if you want to prove this isn't rigged. :-)
