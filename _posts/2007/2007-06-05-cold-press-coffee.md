I had a great coffee moment today that I just have to share. It's worthy of sharing because there is information here that is new to me, and it highlights why small, local coffee shops are great.
I have two "coffee moments" each day. The first one is at home with my [DeLonghi Espresso machine](/thingelstad/triple-caffeine-shotgun-to-the-head) that I'm still loving. Two shots easily obtained with the press of a button. Just great. The second one is in the afternoon with a quick walk to [One on One](http://www.oneononebike.com/) and get some afternoon espresso.

It's summer now, or at least summer enough, and I've now switched to iced drinks in the afternoon. My typical drink is iced espresso. It used to be a triple shot over ice, but I've brought it down to a double shot over ice to reduce the shakes later in the evening (too much caffeine!).

<!-- more -->I like my iced espresso, but it's not very much liquid and just disappears too fast for me. So, I presented my problem to our favorite barista.

<blockquote>_me:_ So, I want an iced drink -- but there just isn't much liquid in iced espresso. What do I do?
_barista: _Well, you could add water to the espresso.
_me:_ That sounds horrible.
_barista: _Or how about iced coffee?
_me: _Brew sucks.
_barista:_ Hmm... how about a cold press?
_me: _Huh? What in the world is a cold press?
_barista:_ It's great. We take a pound of beans and cold brew it with 80 ounces of water for 12 hours...

The conversation about [cold press](http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20070522081621AAl3pyq) continued for quite a while. I got one, and it was perfect! The cold press is never heated, and slow brewed for 12 hours and then pressed through a cloth filter. It's incredibly smooth and wonderful. I've got a new favorite drink!

Your not going to find something like this at most coffee shops. And your also not going to find such a helpful person with their headset on punching your order through their assembly line. What a great discovery. Try a cold press the next time you can. If you like serious coffee on the colder side, you'll love it.
