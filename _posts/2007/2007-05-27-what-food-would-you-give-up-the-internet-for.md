Tammy and I had a really funny conversation today on the way home from the grocery store. I prompted the question of giving up the Internet for something. For example, if you were forced, would you give up chocolate, or the Internet. Forever. Not a month, but permanently. Would you never have another bite of chocolate so you could continue to bathe in the wonders of the Internet.
To me this question was simple -- I'd be passing on the chocolate. I love chocolate. Don't get me wrong. [Lindt](http://www.lindt.com/) and [Vosges](http://www.vosgeschocolate.com/) are very special brands in my book. But compared to the Internet, it's no question.

I theorized that if given the choice of continuing to use the Internet or drinking nutrient complete meal replacement shakes that I would have to think for a long time. What flavors exactly? Tammy laughed at me, citing that I wouldn't make it through a single Thanksgiving.

So, that made me wonder, what would your breaking point be? What food do you care so much about that you would abandon the Internet forever for it. Comment here...
