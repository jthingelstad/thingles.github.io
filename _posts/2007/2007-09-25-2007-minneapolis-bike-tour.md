Tammy and I got to be one of the 4,500 participants in the very first [Minneapolis Bike Tour](http://www.minneapolisbiketour.com/) a couple of weekends ago. I road with my [Ironman Brother-in-law](http://iwilltri.com/2007/09/ironman-race-report/). We road the short route and Tammy and her sister rode the longer route.

This was a really great ride. It seems like it's Minneapolis's answer to the [St. Paul Classic](http://www.bikeclassic.org/). I'm really glad they started doing this and even more glad it was so popular. I'm looking forward to riding it again next year. If you enjoy the bike, make a point to do this ride in 2008.
