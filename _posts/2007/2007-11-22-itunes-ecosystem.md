I mentioned in another post how much [I've been enjoying iTunes]({{site.url}}{% link _posts/2007/2007-11-06-itunes-social-edition.md %}). A few weeks ago I extended [my Apple TV]({{site.url}}{% link _posts/2007/2007-03-23-apple-tv-in-the-house.md %}) coverage to the family room and it just hit me as I was looking at my iTunes window how fully evolved the iTunes ecosystem has become. From one application I have all of my music, podcasts, home videos and soon all my DVD's available on iPods, iPhones and couches. This convergence has been promised for so long, and it's great to see it finally delivered.

The ecosystem is not without warts. iTunes needs to get much better at sharing my library with friends and family ala the [Social Edition I wrote about earlier]({{site.url}}{% link _posts/2007/2007-11-06-itunes-social-edition.md %}). I also think that the entire ecosystem does a very bad job with video. It makes no sense that I would subscribe to an "Apple TV version" of a podcast, and separately to an "iPod version". C'mon guys! Figure out a way to put multiple bit rates and file sizes in one package. It's akin to putting Intel and PowerPC, 32-bit and 64-bit applications in one package. Do this for my videos in iTunes and then just put whatever version makes sense for that device on it.

I expect there will soon be a 3rd Apple TV in this world, and hopefully [something for my car too]({{site.url}}{% link _posts/2007/2007-11-21-apple-please-make-this-apple-tv-iphone-icar.md %}). Once movie rentals are added to this and I finish my massive winter DVD ripping project it should be almost entirely complete. Oh, and I need [Lightroom](http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshoplightroom/) to automatically expose collections of photos to iTunes please. :-)
