Everyone wanted to catch a really big Northern on the fishing trip. Big is pretty much anything over 30 inches. I grabbed this 35.5" Northern in the Ball Cap on the day I was fishing with Don. The different fishing spots get names over time, hence the Ball Cap.

The biggest fish of the trip was caught by [Don, with a length of 46 inches](http://thingelstad.com/s/photos/photo/1020384318/20070616-191032-4471jpg.html). Wow!
