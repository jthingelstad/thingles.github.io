Our annual holiday party at the office is coming up this weekend. It has been a tradition for many years to have a theme. There was a black & tie year. There was a year you came as a favorite figure in history. <strike>There was even a cowboy year that didn't go over so well.</strike>
This year the theme is 70's Disco -- and Tammy and I are going all out. Here is a sneak peak!
