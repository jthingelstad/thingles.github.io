It seems that I lost my Crash pen today. This makes me very sad. I've had this pen for a few years and I think it's just supremely cool looking. I've even ordered parts for it in the past.

I think I'm going to have to order a new one. Bummer. I guess on the bright side at least I _can_ order a new one.
