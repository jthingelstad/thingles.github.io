This past weekend Tammy and I drove to Chicago for a long-weekend getaway. We drove there late on Friday, arriving in the early morning of Saturday. We decided to take a trip on the AM side of the radio dial. It's amazing what you find on that side of the dial. In between the crackling of static there are some real gems. I thought I would share some of the great learnings with all of you!

  * The push to raise minimum wages is all a big scheme by the unions to drive labor costs up.


  * America would be a lot better off if we took some lessons from arranged marriages and brought "disgrace" back to our culture.


  * Most notably, it turns out that most people that feel sluggish and lack energy are that way because they aren't having proper bowel movements. With the appropriate cleansing you can feel like you are 20 years old again.

Great stuff. Amazing learnings.
