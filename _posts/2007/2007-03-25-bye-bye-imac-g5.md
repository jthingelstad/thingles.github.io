![]({{ site.url }}{% link /assets/posts/2007/r_imac.jpg %})It's been just over two years since the Mac invasion of my house began with [my first Mac in over a half-decade](/thingelstad/imac-g5), the sleek 20" iMac G5. I bought it as a toy really -- it went on the desk next to the kitchen. I knew I could run [Firefox](http://www.getfirefox.com/) on it and that I could remote desktop to my "real computer" in the office to do "real things". So it started.
Now the Mac's outnumber the PC's in the house. The [Mac Pro](/thingelstad/mac-pro-in-the-house) has taken over that "real computer" in the office. My laptop of choice is my [MacBook](/thingelstad/macbook), leaving the [Sony Vaio](/thingelstad/new-laptop-sony-vgn-s360) to run [Quicken](http://www.quicken.com/) mainly.

It was time for it to go. [My sister](http://www.myspace.com/delphinia9) needed a computer and the iMac still has a decent amount of life left in it. Plus it was the only PowerPC machine in the house. Apple [announced the switch to Intel](http://news.com.com/Its+Intel+inside+for+Apples+Mac/2009-1006_3-5733937.html) just months after I got the iMac G5. I'm going to hold out for a couple of months to get the [rumored newly redesigned iMac](http://www.appleinsider.com/article.php?id=2582). It should also come with [Leopard](http://www.apple.com/macosx/leopard/). Until then my MacBook is going to be chained to the desk by the kitchen pinch hitting.
