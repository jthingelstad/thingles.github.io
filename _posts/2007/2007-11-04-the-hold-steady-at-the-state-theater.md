On Thursday I went to see [The Hold Steady](http://www.theholdsteady.com/) for the first time. The Hold Steady is a Minneapolis-grown band that has now reached some recognition. It was a really good show. They hit all my favorite songs and were really engaging.

The Hold Steady grew out of another band called Lifter Puller. These guys have a good following in the cities, so there were a lot of people at the show that were Hold Steady "devotees". I was a little surprised to be surrounded by a large crowd of people that seemingly knew every word of every song. Felt a bit like I was crashing someone's high school graduation party. After all, three of the band members parents were in the audience.Great show either way. If you haven't listened to The Hold Steady, you should check it out.
