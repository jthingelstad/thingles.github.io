A couple of days ago it was my birthday! _Have I mentioned how amazing my wife is?_ Anyway, it was my birthday, or should I say the week of my birthday. The festivities have continued all the way to today.
We have decided in our household that birthdays are vacation days so I take my birthday, Tammy's and Mazie's off of work and we spend the day as a family. Tammy this year just made the most amazing birthday I could ask for.

It wasn't just the gifts, which were great. It wasn't just the plans and events, which were awesome. Not even the "Dad-oriented" schedule, which was very nice. To be sure, she spoils me greatly. **Thanks Dear! You rock! **

I've learned to appreciate birthdays more since meeting my wife. I've always celebrated them, but we certainly do more now. I continue to prove out my theory of [fractional life](/thingelstad/birthdays-and-setpoints). The years just go by faster and faster.

This years birthday was really special because of all the great things Tammy put together, but also because Mazie was a lot of fun. She knows what presents are now, and she had a great time ripping into **"daddy present!"** and playing with stuff. Amongst other things I got a model train that I hope she likes to watch now, and play with as she gets older.

I'm another year older, and I'm gradually starting to feel like things could slow down now. I love where I'm at right now and it would be great to just pause here for a while. Unfortunately, it doesn't work that way. Plus, I'm positive that this year is going to be **great**.
