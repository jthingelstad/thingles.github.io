[![chameleon_logo.jpg]({{ site.url }}/assets/posts/2007/chameleon_logo.thumbnail.jpg.jpg?format=original)](http://www.mnrollergirls.com/)Last night Tammy and I went to the [Minnesota Rollergirls](http://www.mnrollergirls.com/) with some friends. It was my first time and it was pretty cool! I didn't expect it to suck or anything, but it was much more fun than I expected.
Tammy's favorite team is the [Rockits](http://www.mnrollergirls.com/teams/rockits/), and her favorite player is [Jawbreaker](http://www.mnrollergirls.com/teams/rockits/jawbreaker.php). Jawbreaker is a mighty force out there. I thought [Rebel Stella](http://www.mnrollergirls.com/teams/dagger_dolls/rebel_stella.php) with the [Dagger Dolls](http://www.mnrollergirls.com/teams/dagger_dolls/) was the most fun to watch. She was fast, really athletic and always exciting.

I'd recommend [checking it out](http://www.mnrollergirls.com/events/), and I'd definitely go back. My main recommendation if you do go is to brush up on the [rules](http://www.mnrollergirls.com/about/rules.php) _before_ you go. I spent the first half hour trying to figure out what was going on.
