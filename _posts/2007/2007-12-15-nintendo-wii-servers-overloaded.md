![nav_wii_logo.gif]({{ site.url }}/assets/posts/2007/nav-wii-logo1.gif)It seems that delivering Wii's to stores isn't the only supply problem [Nintendo](http://www.nintendo.com/) has. Every time they release new versions of the software for the [Wii](http://wii.nintendo.com/), and even some of the pay titles available in the Wii Store, their servers get overloaded for days.
I tried updating my system a dozen times and it finally just worked today, a few days after the update went out. I still can't get some of the titles in the Wii Store to successfully download. I'm trying to get [Check Mii Out](http://wii.nintendo.com/check_mii_channel.jsp) now and that fails on every attempt. It spits out these errors about your network setup, but it's really just that their servers are totally overloaded.

Somebody at Nintendo needs to wake up and sign a deal with a content distribution network.
