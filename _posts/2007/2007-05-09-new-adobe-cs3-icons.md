In the most recent iteration of the Adobe product line Adobe decided to make a radical departure with their "iconography". The new [color wheel of icons](http://blogs.adobe.com/jnack/images/wheel-o%27-icons.html) caused quiet a stir with their customers, and even drawn [contests in the community to create alternative icons](http://www.tuaw.com/2007/05/08/replacement-adobe-cs3-icons-galore/). The first program I got with this new look was Lightroom. This week I received my CS3 versions of Photoshop and Illustrator as well. Here the new icons are in my dock.

I'm going to go on the record as saying that I really like these. When they are all lined up in your dock like this they are simple to see, easy to understand and the theme is obvious. Kudos Adobe.
