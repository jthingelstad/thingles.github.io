It's been a long time since June when my father-in-law took all the brother-in-laws fishing in Canada. I made a video from the trip and it was really difficult to get it online. It's just under 15 minutes and I wanted something that could deal with the size. I finally found Vimeo, more on that later.

Without further ado, enjoy the video from the trip.
