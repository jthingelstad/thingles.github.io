We got the [Sony NTM-910](http://www.sonystyle.com/is-bin/+INTERSHOP.enfinity/eCS/Store/en/-/USD/SY_DisplayProductInformation-Print?ProductSKU=NTM910) because it had good reviews, brand reputation and specifically since it was 900MHz and wouldn't collide with our wireless network at 2.4GHz and our wireless phones at 5.8Ghz. However, they just don't work very well at all. The range was horrible and we started to go slowly insane with the random injection of it's "out of range" beeps at various times.
We decided to upgrade to the Rolls-Royce of monitors, the new [Philips Digital SCD-589](http://www.consumer.philips.com/consumer/catalog/product.jsp?language=en&country=US&catalogType=CONSUMER&productId=SCD589_54_US_CONSUMER). This is the first baby monitor to use the new [DECT technology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DECT) that guarantees completely noise-free operation. We started it up today after giving it a thorough charge overnight and initial tests are great. Tammy was able to walk to the top of our cul-de-sac and back without losing any signal. The audio is crystal clear. On top of that you have nice features like knowing the temperature in the kids room, you can talk to them and even start music or lights in the room from the handset. The parent unit is also significantly smaller and lighter, but not as loud at maximum volume as the Sony was.
