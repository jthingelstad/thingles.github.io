I was out in New York last week and couldn't pass up an opportunity to check out the brand new [Apple Store on 14th Street](http://www.apple.com/retail/west14thstreet/). It's worth a visit if you are in town. It's far more spacious than the [Fifth Avenue store](http://www.apple.com/retail/fifthavenue/week/20071216.html) and the glass spiral staircase is impressive. It has three floors which are nice to segment the store up.
