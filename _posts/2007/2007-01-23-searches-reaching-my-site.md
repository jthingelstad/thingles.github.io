I've had [Google Analytics](http://analytics.google.com/) on my website since it became free. It's amazing the amount of detail it gives you. I barely use 10% of the data that it provides.

Recently a friend of mine did some research on search terms that people used to get to his site. I was inspired to do some reflection on the search terms used to get to my site as well. Some observations.

  * While only one person visited with the search phrase **"what is the distribution of coins in your change jar" **that is a very special visit. No doubt hitting on the [Change Game]({{ site.url }}{% link _posts/2004/2004-11-25-change-game.md %}), but this curious person proceeded to click on 41 more pages of the site.
  * A surprising number of people put my URL **"www.thingelstad.com"** into a search engine so they can then click on it and go to my site. It seems the search box and the location box are a bit confusing at times.
  * I'm pretty surprised by how many searches there are for people that work with me and then somehow end up at my site.
  * I've only ever written [one post about the **Earthroamer RV**]({{ site.url }}{% link _posts/2005/2005-07-16-earthroamer-now-this-is-an-rv.md %}), but I'm stunned that it is the most popular search term of people reaching my site.
  * Similarly, I once [entitled a post **"Pokipsy"**]({{ site.url }}{% link _posts/2005/2005-02-27-pokipsy.md %}) and now 59 people have visited using that search term. Not surprisingly they left right away since there isn't a thing about Pokipsy in the post titled Pokipsy.
  * **"Twitterific"**, a [term I used only a two weeks ago]({{ site.url }}{% link _posts/2007/2007-01-06-twitterific.md %}), has already resulted in 21 visits to the site. Amazing!
