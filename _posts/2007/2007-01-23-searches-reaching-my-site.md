I've had [Google Analytics](http://analytics.google.com/) on my website since it became free. It's amazing the amount of detail it gives you. I barely use 10% of the data that it provides.

Recently a friend of mine did some research on search terms that people used to get to his site. I was inspired to do some reflection on the search terms used to get to my site as well. Some observations.



  * While only one person visited with the search phrase **"what is the distribution of coins in your change jar" **that is a very special visit. No doubt hitting on the [Change Game](http://thingelstad.com/s/geek/change-game/img), but this curious person proceeded to click on 41 more pages of the site.


  * A surprising number of people put my URL **"www.thingelstad.com"** into a search engine so they can then click on it and go to my site. It seems the search box and the location box are a bit confusing at times.


  * I'm pretty surprised by how many searches there are for people that work with me and then somehow end up at my site.


  * I've only ever written [one post about the **Earthroamer RV**](http://thingelstad.com/s/uncategorized/earthroamer-now-this-is-an-rv/img), but I'm stunned that it is the most popular search term of people reaching my site.


  * Similarly, I once [entitled a post **"Pokipsy"**](http://thingelstad.com/s/uncategorized/pokipsy/img) and now 59 people have visited using that search term. Not surprisingly they left right away since there isn't a thing about Pokipsy in the post titled Pokipsy.


  * **"Twitterific"**, a [term I used only a two weeks ago](http://thingelstad.com/s/geek/twitterific/img), has already resulted in 21 visits to the site. Amazing!
