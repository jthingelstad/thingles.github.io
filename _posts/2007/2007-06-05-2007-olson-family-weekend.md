This year was the 4th annual Olson Family Weekend (see 2006 [ack! no blog post for 2006!], [2005](/thingelstad/2005-olson-family-weekend), [2004](/thingelstad/grand-superior-getaway)). This year was Angie's turn to plan and there is only one more year before we loop back around for the next round of trips. It was a great weekend and Angie did a great job putting it all together.
We had a great weekend up at the [Lundeen's cabin](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=46.54003,-94.151802&ie=UTF8&t=k&z=12&iwloc=addr&om=1) (huge thanks to Lundeen Sr. for allowing us to overtake their cabin!). The cabin was cramped with 11 people and 3 dogs, but it added to the fun actually. The weather was sketchy but that didn't slow anyone down either.

Rather than reading, go take a look at the [pictures from the weekend](http://photos.thingelstad.com/2007/06/OlsonFamilyWeekend/), or <strike>watch a couple of videos of Mazie from the weekend (thanks for the videos Angie!)</strike> _[I removed the videos from YouTube]_.
