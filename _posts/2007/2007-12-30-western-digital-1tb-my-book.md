[![westerndigital-mb-studio_1.jpg]({{ site.url }}{% link /assets/posts/2007/westerndigital-mb-studio-11.jpg %})](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000WBOP2Q/?tag={{ site.affiliate.amazon }})A long, long time ago I decided to do an experiment. I built a [server with 1 terabyte in storage]{% link _posts/2004/2004-04-02-project-terabyte.md %}. I wanted to see if the average person could deploy a terabyte of storage. The answer to my question was a solid _no_. That was April 2004. It cost a little over $3,000 and was painful. Oh times have changed.
I was loitering around the Apple Store the other day and I saw this nifty little [Western Digital 1TB My Book](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000WBOP2Q/?tag={{ site.affiliate.amazon }}). I was hesitant to purchase this since I figured mail order would be a better deal. I whipped out [my iPhone]{% link _posts/2007/2007-07-01-i-got-my-iphone.md %} and surmised that I was going to pay a $30 "convenience" cost to walk out of the store with it right then. Off I went.

I realize it sounds kind of "old man" of me to say that I'm amazed I can get 1 terabyte in a single disk. But, I am amazed! This is a decent drive too, supporting FireWire 400 and 800, as well as standard USB. As an added bonus it supports eSATA. I have it on my FireWire 800 port with [the Mac Pro]{% link _posts/2006/2006-12-03-mac-pro-in-the-house.md %} and it's nice and fast.

I'm not brave enough to let [Time Machine](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/timemachine.html) take this drive and have it's way with it. I'm going to keep on using [Chronosync](http://www.econtechnologies.com/site/Pages/ChronoSync/chrono_overview.html) to backup home movies, photos and iTunes media to it. I also need to find a place to put the raw DVD rips of 300 discs that I'm planning to start soon. More on that another time...

If you are looking for a big, huge disk to have around this is an easy alternative. Surely a lot easier than building a horrific box with 8 SATA drives. Ugh!
