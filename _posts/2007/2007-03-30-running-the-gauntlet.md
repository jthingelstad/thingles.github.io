Today was a challenging day for Mr. Mom. It started right away. Somehow I slept until 7am and woke up to Mazie saying "Get out" over and over on the baby monitor. Izzy was also very eager to get out of her "house" and do her business outside. I got Mazie first, before letting Izzy out, then brought her upstairs and took Izzy out before Mazie got her fresh diaper. This set the tone for the most of the day it seemed.

Granted I think I brought some of this on myself by planning a lot of things and not scheduling it quiet right. We met up with Grandpa Don in the morning which meant a lot of driving, including a trip into my office, and Mazie fell asleep during all the driving -- way too early! She did another nap in the afternoon after we made a trip to the grocery store to balance it out.

Today was a hot and cold day. The high point was Mazie cuddling up with me on my lap with Izzy hanging out on the couch. Totally cool. The low point was me on my cell phone for a business call, Mazie demanding yogurt in her high chair and Izzy crapping on the floor -- all at once. Ugh! I was getting a bit too frustrated at one point and decided to just put Izzy in her house. Mazie wanted to nothing more than to give Izzy her food. Izzy wanted nothing more than to have it. Dad was right in the middle of it!

A couple of friends came over with dinner, Guiness and cigars tonight along with some much needed relaxation. I'm up way too late, but I wanted to post something before I went to sleep. I'm hoping to wake up before Mazie and avoid the gauntlet tomorrow.
