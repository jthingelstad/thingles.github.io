![](/assets/posts/{{ page.date | date: "%Y" }}/leopard_box_1251.jpg)It's been a busy night here. This morning [Mac OS X](http://www.apple.com/macosx/) 10.5 "Leopard" arrived and I started installing it on all four Macs right away. The upgrade took about an hour on average and the iMac, MacBook Pro and Mac Pro all upgraded flawlessly. The MacBook however didn't fair so well. The upgrade failed and in the process it toasted the boot partition. I ended up reformatting and reinstalling on it.
Initial impressions of Leopard are "[Wow](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/)!". Absolutely loving Spaces! Sharing screens over the network is tremendous. I just got done playing with some of the iChat sharing with a friend and it worked great. I'm pretty pleased so far. To add to it all, I haven't had any application compatibility issues yet. Pretty impressive.

I'll put together some more thoughts later. I'm really happy to finally have Leopard though. If your curious about Leopard, check out the [guided tour](http://www.apple.com/macosx/guidedtour/) Apple posted.
