Tammy, Mazie and I went on a bike ride today. Tammy is prone to comment about how great it is to just "ride your bike". What she means by this is to disregard the crazy gear of cycling -- special shorts, shoes, shirt, socks and everything else -- and just ride your bike. Street clothes. Normal shoes. You know, like "normal" people do. We were riding to [Yum]({{site.url}}{% link _posts/2006/2006-01-22-yum-kitchen-and-bakery.md %}) for lunch, about 17 miles round-trip with a long lunch in the middle. So I went with normal shorts like a normal person.

I have no option to not wear my cycling shoes since all of my bikes have clipless pedals (a must!). But I decided to go ahead and just wear my normal shorts and spare the world me in lycra. This was horrible. It's not just that the cycling shorts have padding that make the saddle more comfortable. It's that regular shorts are hot. They are baggy and restrict leg movement in odd ways. They bunch up all over. It was absolutely horrible.

I'll never ride my bike over 2 miles without cycling shorts again. I've learned my lesson.
