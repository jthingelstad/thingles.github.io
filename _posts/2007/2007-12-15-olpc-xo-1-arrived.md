[My One Laptop Per Child XO-1](/thingelstad/one-laptop-per-child-and-me) arrived today! I haven't had any time to work with it so you will all have to wait to hear my thoughts on it. Some things that jumped right out though include...

  * The keyboard was designed for children (duh!) and is really small. Wow!


  * <strike>So far I haven't been able to get it to join a WPA2 WiFi network.</strike> _See comments below._


  * It's really cute.

To tide everyone over, here are some pictures of Mazie holding it. She's a kid after all! :-)
