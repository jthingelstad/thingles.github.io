I've tweeted my last tweet.If your a diligent visitor to my blog, you'll notice that the [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/) section on the right hand side is no longer there. [My iPhone](/thingelstad/iphone-day-via-twitter) is noticing that the volume of SMS messages has dropped way down. Most importantly my brain is feeling less distracted.I've been a big fan of Twitter for a while now. So far I've created 1,281 tweets. 1,281 little 100 character updates sent who knows where. Now I think I'm done though. There are a number of reasons I decided to get off the Twitter bus.

  * Twitter is addictive, at least for me. The distraction was too pronounced, and while it's fun to keep up with a number of people you wouldn't otherwise see that much -- it also pulls you out of the experience you are having right then.


  * I prefer blogging, and the complete sentences and paragraphs that surround it. While blogging is not incompatible with Twitter, I feel that I'm blogging less in part because I Twitter in between things.


  * It has the potential to lessen the value of in-person discussions. When catching up with a friend I'll think "I saw that on your Twitter" and then we move on. But really, could a 100 character SMS really sum up the richness of a trip to the zoo with your kids?

I don't mean to condemn Twitter. Different strokes for different folks after all. And I do think it's a great platform for mobile live blogging. I've kept [my account](http://twitter.com/thingles) active even though it's disconnected from my phone and everything else just in case I want to use it to [live blog the Folk Festival](/thingelstad/2007-winnipeg-folk-fest-via-twitter) or something. But for now, I bid adieu.If you happen to follow my robot, that account has been deleted.
