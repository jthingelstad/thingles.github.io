[![code_freeze_08_logo.jpg](/assets/posts/{{ page.date | date: "%Y" }}/code-freeze-08-logo1.jpg)](http://www.umsec.umn.edu/code_freeze_08/)I'm presenting at [Code Freeze 2008](http://www.umsec.umn.edu/code_freeze_08/) in January. The title of my presentation is _Innovation in Product Development_.

> Everyone wants to have the next hot product. We are constantly "pushing
the envelope" and "thinking out of the box". We have the aspiration, but
in many cases it doesn't happen. In this discussion we will review key
aspects to fostering innovation in a development team, creating room to
play and ultimately making great products.

I've got some ideas for my presentation and a theme I'm thinking of winding it through. However, I'm curious if you all have anything to say on this topic. What do you think drives innovation in product development? What are the key contributing factors that you see?

Let me know what you think.
