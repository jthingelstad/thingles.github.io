We've been thinking about getting a dog for awhile. We figured we would get one sometime after we had kids, since a dog does make travel a bit harder, and hey, so do kids so why not really make it hard! :-)

Mazie loves dogs. She likes cats as well, and enjoys attempting to smother Logan on a regular basis. Gypsie is more of a flight risk, and rarely does Mazie get to have her way with her. However, Mazie is a big fan of Rusty, Grandpa and Grandma's dog, and Louie, Aunt Angie and Uncle Max's dog.

I've never owned a dog but have flirted with the idea many times. Tammy's folks have always had one. It's a bit of a leap, but today we officially became dog owners (well, at least next Wednesday we will be).

Tammy has been scouting the adoption sites for a good pup. We wanted to adopt a dog, since there are so many (really, that many) dogs that need homes. She found a couple in recent weeks that she really liked but they were adopted instantly. Last night she found one online, made a long drive today to meet her and it was an instant match.

She's a terrier-poodle cross. We'll get her on Wednesday. I'm really excited, and need to learn a lot about dogs.
