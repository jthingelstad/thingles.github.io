Tammy and I had our first of two sessions getting CPR certified last night at the [Twin Cities Red Cross](http://www.redcrosstc.org/). The class was a lot more than just CPR. It really went into general emergency response practices. The 3 C's -- Check, Call, Care.

The last time I took a CPR class was probably 20 years ago and a lot has changed. We've been planning on doing this since Mazie was born, so we're only about two-and-a-half years behind schedule.
