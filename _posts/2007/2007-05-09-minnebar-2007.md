I'm rather late doing my writeup on [Minnebar](http://www.minnebar.org/) 2007. I guess the advantage of being so late is that I get to [reference](http://graemethickins.typepad.com/graeme_blogs_here/2007/04/minnebar_was_gr.html) all the [great](http://concentrationstudios.com/2007/4/22/more-minnebar) [write-ups](http://exold.com/opinion/minnebar-2007) [that](http://www.alttext.com/archives/2007/04/23/minnbar_remembered.html) [other](http://mnteractive.com/archive/minnebar-2-wrap-up/) [people](http://louis.dejardin.org/2007/04/22/minnebar-reprise/) have [done](http://refried.org/blog/209/) [about](http://www.murphybytes.com/?p=405) Minnebar 2007. Let me start by highlighting that [Ben Edwards](http://www.alttext.com/), [Luke Francl](http://luke.francl.org/) and [Dan Grigsby](http://www.unpossible.com/) did an absolutely amazing, fantastic [supercalifragilistic](http://www.google.com/search?q=supercalifragilistic) job of putting together Minnebar. It was simply stunning guys -- and you've set an incredible bar to try to exceed next year.

Here is the _only_ thing that is hard about Minnebar. Both this year and last year it happened to coincide with one of the first, really nice weekends of spring. It's hard being a Minnesotan and foregoing one of those great days to hang out inside. However, you are handsomely rewarded for the tradeoff. I didn't see a lot of the people I had invited. You all missed out!

This year was simply **great**. The attendance was nearly triple last year. There were so many people that I knew in attendance that I ended up not going to that many sessions. In addition to the folks I knew, there were a lot of new faces to meet. I didn't do any formal presenting this year, but I did get asked to lead the Q&A session with [David Heinemeier Hansson](http://www.loudthinking.com/), the creator of [Ruby on Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.com/). It was a fun time, David is a really cool guy and I liked much of what he had to say. [Tim Elliott](http://www.timelliott.us/) got a [recording of the session](http://timelliott.us/2007/04/23/minnebar-podcast-6-david-heinemeier-hansson-interview/), with David's permission, and I'm putting a copy of that here for archival purposes, with permission from Tim.

I also want to give a big thanks to the guys from [ip:House](http://www.iphouse.com/) who provided the free WiFi service for the event. It was simply stunning in quality and capability, and not a single hitch the whole day. Great job guys!

I'm already looking forward to the next [Minnedemo](http://www.minnedemo.org/), and the next Minnebar in 2008!
