[![mlr.gif](/assets/posts/{{ page.date | date: "%Y" }}/mlr1.gif)](http://www.minnelightroom.com/)I continue to really love Lightroom. I've been finding more and more value out of my 35,000 photos with additional metadata. I haven't even really gotten out of the Library module of Lightroom and I'm still supremely happy with it.
A month or so ago I suggested to a couple of friends that we should start a Lightroom User Group. This idea got a turbo-boost when I ran into two developers from the Lightroom team that work in the Adobe office in Minneapolis. It turns out that the Twin Cities is just a great place to do Lightroom stuff!

Tonight [MinneLightroom](http://www.minnelightroom.com/) is officially launched! I have no idea how much uptake this will get. We are going to work with folks at Adobe and the [Twin Cities Photoshop User Group](http://www.photoshopusersgroup.com/twin_cities/) to get the word out. I'm hoping that we can get some momentum and have a group of fun photography people to discuss how to use Lightroom the best!
