A little over a week ago Tammy and I went with [some friends](http://www.thetangens.net/) to see [Electric Arc Radio](http://www.electricarcradio.com/). You may have heard about this group of writers under their other (or previous?) name, the Lit6 Project. The show is hard to describe, this excerpt from their website sets the stage well:


<blockquote>        Imagine this: four writers living together in a little house on a city street, with         Alan Greenspan (yeah, that Alan Greenspan) holed up in a back-yard treehouse and         a punk poet next door. Greenspan plays the clarinet, badly, the poet steps up on         occasion to lay down a few soft words about life, living and the pursuit of whatever,         and the writers invite a band to stay with them as they all scramble around each other's egos._ _

The performance was really cool and very fresh. There were a lot of laughs. Tammy was head over heels for it and can't wait to go back. It's a bit quirky, entirely in a good way.

There is [another show](http://www.electricarcradio.com/?page=dates) this coming weekend, Sept. 29th. Go check it out! I think you'll enjoy it! That's really the only point of this article, to try to raise awareness of this cool thing going on in our city.
