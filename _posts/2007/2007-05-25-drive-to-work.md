I'm having some more fun with the time-elapsed feature of [my new camera](/thingelstad/canon-sd750). It has an ability to take the most trivial things and make them at least a little interesting. Check out this video of my morning drive. There is a decent amount of sun glare, and the "mount" wasn't all that great, but it's still fun. I think I'll do it again after I get a [Gorillapod](http://www.joby.com/products/gorillapod/findmygpod/) that will give me a better mount. Until then...
Also check out the short [time-elapsed video of my flight take-off](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wi8p2PzFXbE).
