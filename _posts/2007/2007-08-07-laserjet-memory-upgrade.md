I think I'm like most people and never really think about my printer. Last week though I thought about it a lot as I waited forever to have it print some really complicated documents. I decided to take action and ordered some more memory. I just got done slapping a 128MB DIMM in my HP LaserJet 1320. Why? Because you can and it costs so very little. And I expect I'll have this printer for a good long while. It sure prints faster.
