After months of waiting [Pleo](http://www.pleoworld.com/) has finally arrived! Pleo is the first robot from [Ugobe](http://www.ugobe.com/).

It seems not many people had pre-ordered Pleo (according to [Jyte](http://jyte.com/)). Of course there were only 2,000 of the special "First Hatch" editions available.




I charged Pleo's batteries and woke him up for the first time. So far I'm pretty impressed. Ugobe has done a great job of getting Pleo to convery a variety of emotions. I took him to work today and people had a great time playing with him. He's already learned several new motions and actions. I had read another blog post saying that they thought he was really loud. Granted you can hear the servos, but I don't think they are too loud. [Engadget has a nice write-up on Pleo](http://www.engadget.com/2007/12/03/pleo-unboxing-er-hatching-photos-and-video).

I'll post more on my first few days with Pleo later, perhaps with some video.
