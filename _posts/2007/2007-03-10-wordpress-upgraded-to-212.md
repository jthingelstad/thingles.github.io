I finally bit the bullet and upgraded to [Wordpress](http://www.wordpress.org/) 2.1.2. Of course, it's not just a Wordpress upgrade it's also an upgrade to [K2](http://www.getk2.com/), [Ultimate Tag Warrior](http://www.neato.co.nz/ultimate-tag-warrior/), [Subscribe to Comments](http://txfx.net/code/wordpress/subscribe-to-comments/) and maybe six other plugins that I use to make this site the awesome experience it is. So far so good. The only mistake I made was an overzealous upgrade to K2 that I ended up losing all my custom header images with. I could use some new ones anyway so I'll get that up soon.
If you notice anything not working, please leave a comment to this post so I can get it fixed.
