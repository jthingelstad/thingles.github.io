Last night Tammy and I joined [some friends](http://www.jimbernard.net/) and attended the launch party for [MinnPost.com](http://www.minnpost.com/). MinnPost is an interesting new non-profit trying to bring the public radio model online to produce quality journalism ([more](http://www.minnpost.com/about/)). It is founded by Joel Kramer and has a cadre of writers signed on. The site just launched this last Thursday. I'm hoping they do some great stuff.

MinnPost is still very early. They just passed 400 members and the momentum is good. Good luck to the crew! And [give it a read](http://www.minnpost.com/)... and [become a founding member](http://www.minnpost.com/donate/).

PS - The site has already been parodied at [MinnToast.com](http://www.minntoast.com/). Funny stuff.
