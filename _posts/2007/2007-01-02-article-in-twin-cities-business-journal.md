[I was featured in an article](http://twincities.bizjournals.com/twincities/stories/2007/01/01/story4.html?b=1167627600%5e1396237&surround=etf) published last Friday in the [Twin Cities Business Journal](http://twincities.bizjournals.com/twincities/) about what Dow Jones is doing here in Minneapolis, specifically some of the R&D; work that we've been focused on.

While the article suffers from some inaccuracies, for example, the entire office is not about Dow Jones Online but is instead many different divisions of [Dow Jones](http://www.dowjones.com/). It seems I can never get through an interview for an article without something like that happening.

I'm happy to get the word out. I've been trying to get more publicity for what we are doing in Minneapolis since far too few people understand what we are doing, and we need all the best talent we can get.
