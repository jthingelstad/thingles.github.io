I've grown tired of the [Wordpress](http://www.wordpress.org/) theme I was using, [K2](http://www.getk2.com/). It's a nice theme, but I didn't like how heavy it was and I started growing more frustrated that it wasn't "stretchy". I searched for a bit tonight for something better and after trying a number of them out, I found [blog.txt](http://www.plaintxt.org/themes/blogtxt/). I wasn't sure about it at first, but I'm really liking it now. It's super, super-simple and I like the elegance of it. I'm having some trouble getting [Ultimate Tag Warrior](http://www.neato.co.nz/ultimate-tag-warrior/) to play with it, but I think it's doable.
Let me know what you think, or if you find something broken.

**Update**

I have tags working now, although it's not perfect. I've sent a note to the [theme creator](http://scottwallick.com/) to see what his plans are. I'm thinking he's going to wait for Wordpress 2.2 and native tags support rather than messing with Ultimate Tag Warrior. I also got [Extended Live Archive](http://www.sonsofskadi.net/extended-live-archive/) working in the [archives](/archives). That makes me happy since I think the AJAX work in ELA is so helpful for that function -- not just eye candy.

I'm liking this theme a lot -- I like that it leaves the focus on the actual content and spares some of the cruft. I re-enabled some plugins (like [Share This](http://alexking.org/projects/wordpress/readme?project=share-this)) although I'm not sure that I like the cruft it adds. We'll see.

I've also enabled [WP-Cache](http://mnm.uib.es/gallir/wp-cache-2/) for the first time. It seems transparent and promises speed improvements. I expect the site will be a ton faster for everyone already since the new theme is so much smaller than K2.  I also dropped the number of items on the blog main page to 5. I expect that nobody reads down the page.
