Last week I called home while on my way to a meeting in New York. To my surprise when the phone was answered Mazie was on the other end saying "Hello Daddy!". Immediately beaming, I responded with "Hello Mazie! How are you doing?" Mazie isn't much of a talker on the phone but I coaxed out of her that her babies were up already and that she had slept well.

Then I heard Tammy's voice. I figured Tammy had answered the phone and had given it to Mazie. Nope! Turns out she picked it up and answered it herself. Tammy had stepped outside for a moment. How cool. Mazie's first phone call. :-)
