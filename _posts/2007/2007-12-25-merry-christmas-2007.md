Christmas 2007 is a wrap! Great time with family. Mazie really started to [grok](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok) the holiday this year and was pretty excited. She loves presents. In honor of the season and Dad traditions, here is a time lapse video of me and Grandpa Don assembling Mazie's new doll house. She's totally digging it.
