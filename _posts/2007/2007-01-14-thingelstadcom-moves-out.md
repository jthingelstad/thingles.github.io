I spent a couple of hours getting this website moved out of the server in my laundry room and to the faster server that I'm now renting in a remote data center at [ValueWeb](http://www.valueweb.com/). This will finally give the site more bandwidth for you -- the valued reader.

It wasn't pain free, and in fact there is a bit of a mess to clean up still with **some things not working**. I'll get that resolved shortly.

On the plus side of got big huge bandwidth pipes and the URL structure for the site is much more friendly than it was before (no more index.php). I also updated to the newest version of [WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org/) which may be some of my pain.


I'm very interested to hear if the site "feels" faster now. If you don't mind, let me know by [commenting here](/2007/01/14/thingelstadcom-moves-out/#respond).
