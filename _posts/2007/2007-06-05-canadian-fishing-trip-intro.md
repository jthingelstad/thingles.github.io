I will soon be departing on a [Canadian Fishing Adventure](https://thingles.backpackit.com/pub/885111). T-minus _nine days_ before I head out with my father-in-law and all my brother-in-laws to Canada for a week of fishing giant fish. Really giant fish. Fish that, if you are not careful, can severely injure you. I'm not an expert fisherman. I'm not even a basic fisherman. I haven't fished for a decade, and this trip will double the amount of time I've fished in probably my entire life. This fills me with some trepidation.
However, I'm also really excited. This isn't the type of trip I would typically go on so it's fun to try something completely outside of your typical zone. Plus, fishing is loaded with gear and I'm a gear addict so that is fun. We'll be departing for our trip and heading into the great unknown with a sun that never sets and [more water than land](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=N52.88794+W87.85125&ie=UTF8&t=k&om=1&ll=52.893785,-87.845306&spn=0.108533,0.300064&z=12&iwloc=addr), [GPS](http://www.garmin.com/products/gpsmap60csx) in hand of course.

I've ordered some wacky natural bars to take along called [Figamajigs](http://www.figamajigs.com/). They are supposedly pretty good, and should be a nice break if desired.

Forget phone lines. Forget cellular. There is a little bit of power via a solar panel and a generator that can be started from time to time. Digital cameras and such can be charged, but that's about it. This will be the longest that I'll have gone offline for quiet some time. The urge to pick up a [satellite phone](http://www.readysatgo.net/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=40) is strong, but the price point is enough to push that urge aside. Plus I'd probably be stoned if I showed up with some crazy phone.

I've got a little bit of additional gear to get or arrive via UPS. We are limited to 80 pounds of gear and I'm probably going to be right up against that with fishing stuff, photography stuff and clothes. I'm going to journal while I'm there and post when I return. I'm looking forward to the northern waters, really huge fish, time with the guys and giant fish stories to lie about when I return.
