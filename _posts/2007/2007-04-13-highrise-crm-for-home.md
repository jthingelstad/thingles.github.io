[![logo-highrise.png]({{ site.url }}{% link /assets/posts/2007/logo-highrise1.png %})](http://www.highrisehq.com/)I realize that I'm probably on the verge (or well past the point) of being considered a [37 Signals](http://www.37signals.com/) "[fanboi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanboy)". I've written already about [how much I like Backpack](/thingelstad/fanatical-about-backpack). I still use it every single day, it's one of very few things I pay a monthly fee for and never regret it. It is my homepage on all my personal computers. A few weeks ago when I started seeing some of the early information on [Highrise](http://www.highrisehq.com/) I was rather dismissive of it. It seemed like a streamlined, "[kiss](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)" version of [Salesforce.com](http://www.salesforce.com/). I figure I didn't have a need for this -- unlike [the knob](/thingelstad/the-knob)._ (Note, CRM in the title here is [Customer Relationship Management](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management).)_
I started using Highrise just to see what it did and explore how the 37 Signals team had built it. It's a great application, incredibly and simply designed. I'd encourage anyone that builds web applications to check it out just to experience the user interface. I decided to give it a go for my "personal business". Things like tax preparation with the accountant, projects being done at the house, etc. I warmed slowly to it, and am really liking it now. Highrise has some great features that make it useful even in solo mode, with only me using it. I never would have thought this type of function would be that useful for personal purposes, but it's pretty nice.

On a side note, I can totally see how a company of 100 or fewer employees would really benefit from Highrise. In fact, the combination of [Highrise](http://www.basecamphq.com/) (customer, vendor management), [Basecamp](http://www.basecamphq.com/) (project management) and [Campfire](http://www.campfirenow.com/) (distributed meetings) fill out most of what a small- to medium-sized company would need for collaboration.
