![boogie-wonderland.jpg]({{ site.url }}/assets/posts/2007/boogie-wonderland1.jpg)Oh my. Really. Wow. Absolutely fabulous!
That is the only way to start any post on the 2007 Dow Jones Disco Party that we had this year. I've been slow to get a post up because I wanted to get the [photos online](http://thingelstad.com/s/photos/album/72157603503507480/2007-Dow-Jones-Disco-Party.html). This years party was a complete blast. I had given a [preview of the Disco Theme](/thingelstad/upcoming-office-holiday-party) in another post and people did not hold back at all in going all out.

Great food. Amazing band, [Boogie Wonderland](http://www.boogiewonderland.com/). Disco music. Awesome people! How can you go wrong! Party along with this video!

Every year it gets better and I really cannot imagine how next year could top this one.
