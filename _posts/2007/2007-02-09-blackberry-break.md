I just got back home after a business trip. This trip entailed an offsite training event. At any event like this you have a couple of breaks in the morning and afternoon. These used to just be a "Break". A decade ago when cell phones really became prevalent these turned into "Communication Breaks". Everyone would dash out of the room and dial up their mobiles.
The vernacular has changed! It is now "Blackberry Breaks". I believe this now makes the 'crackberry' a brand like Kleenex. Even the couple of people with non-Blackberry Blackberry's like Treos and Windows Mobile devices were enjoying their "Blackberry Break".

I wonder if we'll be takin "iPhone Breaks", or just an "iBreak".
