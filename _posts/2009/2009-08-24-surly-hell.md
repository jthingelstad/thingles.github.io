I got an email from [Four Firkins](http://www.thefourfirkins.com/) at 10:13 am that they had received their very first limited shipment of Surly Hell. They were limiting sales to 2 4-packs per customer, and opening 2 hours earlier to accomodate. I immediately mobilized with my neighbor Mike and off we went. Got the last four 4-packs in the cooler. They sent an email at 11:47 am saying:

<blockquote>Sorry people, it was crazy in here, it's all gone.

It tastes delicious.
