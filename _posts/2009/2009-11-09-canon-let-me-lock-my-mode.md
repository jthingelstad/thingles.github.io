I've been absolutely loving my new [Canon 5D Mark II](http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&fcategoryid=139&modelid=17662). It's a serious camera and having a full-frame sensor means I'm shooting a lot with my [Canon 70-200mm f/2.8L IS USM lens](http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&fcategoryid=150&modelid=7469). Together though, that combination weighs over **5 pounds** and I rarely want to put that around my neck. I tend to sling the camera over my shoulder instead which actually works quiet well, with one really big problem.

The dial pictured above is the [mode dial](http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/canoneos5Dmarkii/page8.asp). It is one of the most important controls and pretty much changes everything about the cameras behavior. I tend to shoot mostly in Av mode when I'm out and about. When I sling the camera over my shoulder with the 70-200mm lens I carry it "upside down" so the lens hangs in a natural way. Unfortunately, that means this knob will rest against my side, and as I walk it can **move into a different mode!**

You then lift the camera and shoot only to realize you are in some crazy mode and the pictures are horrible!

If there was ever a control that could use a small, flip-lock this is it. It needs a safety.
