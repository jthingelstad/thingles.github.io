![bge-gasket](/assets/posts/{{ page.date | date: "%Y" }}/bge-gasket.jpeg)Brand new gasket for the large Big Green Egg tonight. It always feels like the grill is shiny and new with a brand new gasket. It closes with a soft thud, and the seal is perfect. Time for an extra low temperature smoke with a perfect gasket.
