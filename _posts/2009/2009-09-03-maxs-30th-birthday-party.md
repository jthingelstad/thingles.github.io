My brother-in-law Max turned 30 today and there was a nice get together at the [Bayside Grill](http://www.bayviewevent.com/grille.html) on [Lake Minnetonka](http://www.lakeminnetonka.com/) to celebrate. Just a few photos from the evening. I wasn't able to get even a small fraction of all the people in attendance. Sorry to all those not pictured here.
