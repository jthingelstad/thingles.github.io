I'm very late in sharing this news. Starting at the beginning of this year I was asked to join the board of directors at [CaringBridge](http://www.caringbridge.org/). I've been hoping to find a non-profit that fit well with my background, and CaringBridge was perfect. I've been very impressed learning more about CaringBridge and the amazing and wonderful relationships that they enable.

Unfamiliar with CaringBridge?

<blockquote>CaringBridgeÂ® offers free, personalized websites that allow people to stay in touch with family and friends during a health crisis, treatment and recovery.  The goal of the service is to ease the burden of keeping friends and family updated, while also providing a way for them to send their love, support and encouragement.

I've found that an amazing number of my friends have used CaringBridge in one way or another. They have done amazing work thus far and I'm hoping I can help continue that! If you have a CaringBridge story or comment I'd love to hear it!
