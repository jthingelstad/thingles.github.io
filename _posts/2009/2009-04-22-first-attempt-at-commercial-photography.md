I've been continuing to work on my photography skills and looking for projects to work on that are fun and help me learn more. I've worked out for a long time at a local personal training studio, [Select Fitness](http://www.myselectfitness.com/). I had looked at the photos of the studio on their website and thought I could get them some better shots. Here are my photos.

  1. Photographing a space like this was a lot more difficult than I expected. I tried to think through the uses of the photos and frame things right, but it wasn't obvious to me exactly what and how I should be shooting.


  2. I wanted to use motion to capture some energy. I think it worked okay on the treadmill, allowing the picture to focus on the equipment and keep the people in the frame to show action and energy. However, I tried this on some other shots and it didn't work very well.


  3. Lighting is key, and I am a complete newbie to lighting issues.

Of all the shots I took I think I liked this one with the weight stack and leg press the most. I really like the lines of the equipment and the shapes of the weights. The wall in the background makes a nice backdrop. I could see this being used with type over the top of it in really interesting ways as well.
