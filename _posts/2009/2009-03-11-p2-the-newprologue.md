I was a fan of the original Prologue, and this [new iteration of it looks even better](http://thingelstad.com/s/2009/03/11/p2-the-new-prologue/img).
I'm struck by how easy it would be to setup a private Twitter-like service for just the people you want to hang with. That could be fun, particularly as Twitter becomes less and less interesting and more and more overcrowded.
