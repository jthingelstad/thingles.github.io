Upon upgrading to iTunes 9 today I noticed that some old iPhone restore images had been dumped in my trash. I'm not real sure where they were being kept before, but the trash now had this stuff in it.

Nifty. That cleared up 1,793 MB of storage that was never going to be used again. Especially the files for iPhone 1,1 - a device I don't even own anymore.
