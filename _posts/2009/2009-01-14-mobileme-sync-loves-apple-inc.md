![apple-mess-address-book-mobileme.png](/assets/posts/2009/apple-mess-address-book-mobileme.png)I was really hoping that the 10.5.6 Mac OS X update, which promised nice improvements to MobileMe sync, would solve this incredibly annoying problem that I've had for a long time with MobileMe. I'm not exactly sure what is going on, but for some reason the Address Book entry for Apple, Inc. replicates itself. Again. And again. And again.
I've yet to identify the pattern, or a possible solution. I routinely, at least weekly, will launch address book and select several Apple, Inc. address book entries and then select Merge Selected Cards to consolidate them back to one. Wait a few more days and I'll have multiple entries again.

This seems to be a special case with this card. It doesn't happen with any other cards that I have. Anyone else see this behavior? Or better, know how to fix it?
