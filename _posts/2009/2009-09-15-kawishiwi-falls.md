While we were up in Ely this past weekend we took a brief hike out to Kawishiwi Falls. I'm a sucker for waterfalls so it doesn't take much to fill me with awe. I took video with the [Canon 5D Mark II](http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&fcategoryid=139&modelid=17662) to capture the scene and continue to get comfortable with the video capabilities of the camera.

Overall I'm very impressed with the video quality. What you see here is "web video" processed by at least three different conversion processes. The raw video off the camera is incredibly crisp. All these were shot with the [Canon 70-200mm f/2.8L IS](http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&fcategoryid=150&modelid=7469).

I [photographed this waterfall in winter](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jthingelstad/tags/kawishiwifalls/) during the [Wintergreen Photography Dog Sledding trip I took]({{site.url}}{% link _posts/2009/2009-02-12-photos-from-wintergreen-dog-sledding-trip.md %}). There are a good number of [photos of Kawishiwi Falls on Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/kawishiwifalls/interesting/) if you want to see more.
