Mazie is about to turn 4 years old and she is bubbling with excitement about it. She tells me regularly how many days until her birthday, and that she will be able to jump higher and possibly grow several inches when she turns 4.

I've been thinking that it would be really fun to setup the video camera and ask her some questions. Essentially an interview. My idea is to put together a set of questions that would stay pretty constant and to do a video like this on her birthday each year, until she tells me to bugger off. :-)

I love the idea of capturing this, and capturing how things change over time. It's obvious to me that simple questions should be included, like...



  * What is your favorite color?


  * What is your favorite food?


  * Who are your best friends?


  * What is your favorite thing to do?

I'd like to get this right though and I'm positive that there are several questions that I'm not thinking of. That's the reason for this post...

**what would you ask your kid?**

I would really like to get the perspective of those much wiser than me, so please chime in.

**Update (June 9, 2011):** I've started to maintain a [list of questions that I ask](http://wiki.thingelstad.com/wiki/Birthday_Questions) Mazie on these videos.
