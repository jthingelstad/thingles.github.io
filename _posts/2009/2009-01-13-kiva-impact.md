Iâ€™ve been a Kiva user for over a year now and have done several micro-loans with it. This is a really cool video that shows the personal side of Kiva and how such micro-loans can really impact peoples lives. Check out my lender page.I owe a thanks to Aaron Oliver for introducing me to Kiva with a gift, to regift through a loan.
