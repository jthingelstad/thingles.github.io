I just pulled the data out of my [Garmin GPSmap 60CSx](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000CSOXTO/?tag={{ site.affiliate.amazon }}) from my [dog sledding trip](). I just love being able to go into the wilderness and just drop my GPS somewhere with a little visibility and get a perfect track log. I fired up [GPS Babel](http://www.gpsbabel.org/) and got the data into [KML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kml) format and you can now see it in [Google Earth](http://earth.google.com/), check out [Wintergreen 2009 Photography Workshop in Google Earth](http://thingelstad.com/s/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/wintergreen-2009.kmz).

If you don't have Google Earth installed, you can [see it in Google Maps](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=http:%2F%2Fwww.thingelstad.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2009%2F02%2Fwintergreen-2009.kmz&ie=UTF8&t=h&ll=47.86558,-91.771202&spn=0.067831,0.129776&z=13) using your browser too.
