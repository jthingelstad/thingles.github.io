This last weekend I grabbed a copy of [Flight Control](http://www.firemint.com/flightcontrol/index.html) for my iPhone. It looked like the kind of game that I can get into. I like puzzle style games and have an affinity to 2D-gaming over 3D-gaming. I was pretty much immediately hooked.
The premise of Flight Control is simple. You have a top-down perspective of a landing field and you have to draw flight paths with your finger for each plane to land. There are different types of planes that fly at different speeds. Over time, the planes come faster and faster.

The game is addicting. I've now got a high score of 57 but am stumped how you get much past that.
