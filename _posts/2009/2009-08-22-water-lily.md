We were having a nice afternoon at [Como Park](http://www.comozooconservatory.org/) today and the [Water Lily area](http://www.comozooconservatory.org/cons/garden/lilies.shtml) was just breathtaking. Sometimes the subject is so amazing that you just need to point the camera and shoot. Minus a slight crop, this is straight off the Canon 5D Mark II sensor through the 70-200mm f/2.8L.
