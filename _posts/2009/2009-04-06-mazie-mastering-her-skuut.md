It was the first weekend in April, but that didn't get it warm. In fact we had snow overnight this weekend and woke up to at least an inch of wet snow in the morning. That didn't stop us from heading outside and for Mazie to spend some more time mastering her Skuut. She is very excited to "get a bicycle and not even need stabilizers".
