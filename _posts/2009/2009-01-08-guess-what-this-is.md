Thought this looked cool. Know what's going on here?

_Note: the music doesn't have anything to do with the scene._

_Marc DeBrey got it mostly right in the comments below. We were having some painting done in our house, specifically this was painting the ceiling. The painter had taped and put up plastic everywhere to keep things clean, and after finishing he fired up a good sized fan to speed up the drying. I went in the room and there was this roaring fan and the plastic moving all around -- it looked kind of cool._
