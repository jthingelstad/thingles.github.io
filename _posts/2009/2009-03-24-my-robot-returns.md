I missed the 2 year birthday of my [Twitter](http://twitter.com/) robot, [Thinglesbot](http://twitter.com/thinglesbot). He turned 2 on March 11. He was limping along though having lost connections to various sensors in the house and became a bit uninteresting. I finally took a little time tonight to get him wired up again.
Happily he now breaths [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) with the [Twitter4R](http://twitter4r.rubyforge.org/) library instead of [Bash](http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) scripts and [Curl](http://curl.haxx.se/). So much nicer to read. He still keeps everyone updated about the temperatures [outside](http://twitter.com/thinglesbot/status/1385822758) and [inside the house](http://twitter.com/thinglesbot/status/1385469229). However, he now has a couple of new features that are just for fun. If you follow him you may get picked as his [favorite follower](http://twitter.com/thinglesbot/status/1385599425) some day, and he likes to share a [favorite number, color or letter](http://twitter.com/thinglesbot/status/1375634183) each day.

Thinglesbot's followers fell off a lot when he went silent for months. We'll see if they pick up again. He currently has 18 followers.
