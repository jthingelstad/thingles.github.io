Last weekend I made three trips to the [Sierra Bravo](http://www.sierra-bravo.com/) [Overnight Website Challenge](http://f1webchallenge.com/) to get some photos of the start, middle and end. I lugged a [decent bit of gear]{% link _posts/2009/2009-02-28-photographing-the-overnight-website-challenge.md %} and tried my first attempt at event photography.




The event wasn't simple to capture. The room wasn't very interesting so it was hard to get a decent backdrop on people. The podium where people presented had natural light behind it which made it nearly impossible to photograph. I tried some long exposure stuff and it was a little interesting. All in all, a tough room. I think my favorite shot is the one I took of the [Ruby.MN 2.2 Team](http://www.f1webchallenge.com/teams/27-Ruby-mn-2-2) right before the event started.

I thought there would be more opportunities for pictures of people sleeping but there were surprising few that actually caught any sleep. I tried, unsuccessfully, to get one of the teams to do a human pyramid.
