For the first time I decided to try some canning. I didn't feel confident enough to do real canning, so I'm just doing some freezer canning. I got 20 pounds of tomatoes at the [Mill City Farmers Market](http://www.millcityfarmersmarket.org/) over the weekend. They were organically grown on a farm about 70 miles outside of town. I cleaned them all and ran them through the food processor. I put the whole lot into a big kettle and reduced it at low heat for a few hours, just stirring every 30 minutes or so.
I got 12 pints of tomato sauce out of it. I chose to not put anything into the sauce so I can use it in anything I want. I'm going to place these in the freezer for some local tomato dishes this winter. The house smelled really nice while the tomatoes where simmering down.
