[I Am Here: One Man's Experiment With the Location-Aware Lifestyle](http://www.wired.com/gadgets/wireless/magazine/17-02/lp_guineapig)
I've done some playing with location-aware applications, mostly [Brightkite](http://brightkite.com/people/thingles), and this article rang true to some of the thoughts and challenges I had with them as well. Location-awareness brings a new dimension to the web, but it will take some time to figure out how to do it right. His example of how easily he was able to find out where a woman he saw taking pictures in the park lived is an eye opener.
