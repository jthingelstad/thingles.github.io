This weekend, thanks to my awesome wife, I got to spend Saturday and Sunday at a photography workshop. The workshop was led by John Gregor of [ColdSnap Photography](http://coldsnap.com/). It was a two day workshop focused on composition as well as technique. We started both days shooting over by [Lake Harriet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Harriet_(Hennepin_County,_Minnesota)) in the [Peace Garden](http://www.minneapolisparks.org/default.asp?PageID=4&parkid=349) and [Rose Garden](http://www.minneapolisparks.org/default.asp?PageID=4&parkid=350) and finished the second half of the day with seminars held at the [REI in Bloomington](http://www.rei.com/stores/15).

I enjoyed the class a lot. John is a talented photographer and importantly a good teacher. Our first day of shooting was miserably cold, cloudy and windy. A difficult combination. The second day saved it all though with beautiful sun and still skies. John had a deep understanding of some technical areas of photography that few people appreciate, notably color spaces.

Here are the photos that I picked as my favorites from the two days of shooting.
