A few days ago I took the leap and jumped to a new camera body. I made the big jump and moved to a [Canon 5D Mark II](http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&fcategoryid=139&modelid=17662). I'm loving it, and will write up some comments later about it later.
One of the very interesting and new things the 5D Mark II introduces is the ability to do full high-definition video through high-end glass on your camera. I'm still playing with it, and in the spirit of play, here is a frog.

This was shot using the 5D with a [50mm macro lens](http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&fcategoryid=155&modelid=7323) and the [life-size converter](http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&fcategoryid=155&modelid=8121). This gave me a depth of field that was about 1mm. The frog was actually positioned outside on a window sill, and I had the camera on a tripod mounted right up on the glass inside. Probably 2 inches from the frog.
