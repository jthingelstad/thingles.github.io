I was flipping through the [March 14th copy](http://www.economist.com/printedition/index.cfm?d=20090314) of [The Economist](http://www.economist.com/) and ran across "[The final reel](http://www.economist.com/world/unitedstates/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13279016)" story. [Fisher-Price](http://www.fisher-price.com/) is no longer going to make the [View-Master](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/View-master). It was an odd article. I felt rather sad. I think because I distinctly remember as a little boy looking through my own View-Master and being amazed at the images and also completely obsessed trying to figure out how it worked. The experience continued this summer as [Mazie enjoyed looking at her very own View-Master](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jthingelstad/2506880671/in/photostream/).
Going forward kids will only be able to get reels of animated characters and other licensed, copyrighted characters for the View-Master.
