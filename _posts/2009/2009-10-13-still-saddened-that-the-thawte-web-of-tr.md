Still saddened that the [Thawte](http://www.thawte.com/) [Web of Trust](http://www.thawte.com/secure-email/web-of-trust-wot/index.html?click=main-nav-products-wot) system is being shut down by the new owners, Verisign. Anyone surprised since Verisign offers a pay product that Thawte did for free? To make matters worse, I had become a Thawte notary a few months ago.
_It's crazy that while they have sent emails to everyone the Web of Trust website doesn't indicate anything about it going away. They are still happily letting people sign up? Huh?_
