Sometimes I get really excited by projects we have done around the house ([garage shelves](/thingelstad/garage-shelves-awesome), [rain gutters](/thingelstad/rain-gutters-installed)). Right now I'm really excited about the new decking boards that we had put on our deck. Our deck surface was original with the house, now 20 years old. The boards were rotting out in places and the nails constantly were coming loose. This weekend Terry Owens, the awesome owner of [Como Lake Carpentry](http://www.comolakecarpentry.com/), pulled off all the old wood and replaced it with brand new cedar.

Now we've got great new wood with a wonderful neutral stain. Here are some more shots of the new deck.
