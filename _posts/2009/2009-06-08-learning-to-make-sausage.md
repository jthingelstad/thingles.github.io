A couple of weekends ago we all loaded up into the car and drove up to [Grand Marais](http://grandmarais.com/) to spend a wonderful weekend with our friends [the Tangen's](http://www.thetangens.net/). As is often the case when going "up north", it was really crazy cold. It was the end of May and on our last day it was barely above freezing.

Anyway, the main attraction of the trip was a class that Tammy had signed Kent and I up for at the [North House Folk School](http://northhouse.org/). North House is a very cool place where you can go and learn hundreds of skills. While we were learning the in's and out's of sausage making, another group of people were learning how to build a brick oven.

Back to the sausage. Another friend, [Kevin Dotzenrod](http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=680963914), makes the most amazing sausage I've ever eaten. I've got a few feet of it left in the freezer that I'm coveting from everyone else. I really only like lean sausage with a lot of flavor. Tammy thought it would be fun for me to learn how to make it myself and that's how Kent and I found ourselves elbow deep in meat.

The experience was captured best with video. Since I was running the camera this video is all [Kent](http://twitter.com/ktangen). I am excited to try my hand at making some of my own sausage just the way I like it.
