Fired up the Big Green Egg and did a 3 lb. grass-fed beef tenderloin on it tonight. Basic preparation with a little salt and pepper. Turned out really nice, but I still have much to learn. Controlling the heat on the Egg at 400° F was harder than it should have. I could have done a better job building the fire.
