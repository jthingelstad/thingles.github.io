title: Dropping the www

I've debated this many times, but finally decided to pull the trigger and remove the "www." prefix from my website. This really isn't anything that anybody need worry about. You will be redirected as appropriate to the right spot. I've been hesitant to drop the www because the search engines see it as www.thingelstad.com, not thingelstad.com. However, [Google Webmaster tools](http://www.google.com/webmasters/) seems to make this an easy change.

So, away with the "www."
