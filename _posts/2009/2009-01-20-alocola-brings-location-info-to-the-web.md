[![Alocola Logo.png](/assets/posts/2009/alocola-logo.png)](http://alocola.com/)My buddy [Dan Grigsby](http://www.unpossible.com/) has just launched his first iPhone application. The application fills an interesting gap, it allows a web site to get the location information from the iPhone. Sure, iPhone applications can do this with the iPhone SDK, but if you are a plain old web site or web application (and yes, there is still a place for them), Alocola will allow you to get that information via the web.
[Alocola](http://alocola.com/) is a helper application that Safari launches and then it just gets the location info and returns it back to the requesting website. Slick! Great idea.

All the cooler, Dan will be making the source code available under [GPL2](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html).
