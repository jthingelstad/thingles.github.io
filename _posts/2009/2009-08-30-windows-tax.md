![winxp-logo]({{ site.url }}{% link /assets/posts/2009/winxp-logo.png %})We have been in [Lignite, ND](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=lignite,+nd&sll=44.90482,-93.438463&sspn=0.008997,0.017509&ie=UTF8&ll=48.877361,-102.564926&spn=0.26734,0.560303&t=h&z=11) this weekend visiting my family. It's really nice to see everyone. In addition to great relatives, I've had less stellar visits with a couple of Windows XP machines that needed various levels of help. Mostly cleaning up junk and updating things, however, my aunt had a full blown spyware infestation that was fairly gnarly. Microsoft owes me about 5 hours of time from this trip.
