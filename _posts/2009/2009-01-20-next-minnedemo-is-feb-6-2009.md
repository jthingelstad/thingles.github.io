The next [Minnedemo](http://minnedemo.org/) is now scheduled for February 6, 2009 at 7:00pm. It is free (as always), but registration is required so go there and [get signed up](http://minnedemo.eventbrite.com/). There are about 260 open tickets left at this point.

Even though it is free that doesn't mean you can leave your wallet at home. [Intermedia Arts](http://intermediaarts.org/) is the host for Minnedemo and they have [fallen on some difficult times](http://intermediaarts.org/updates.php#fastforward). There will be an opportunity to donate Intermedia Arts ([read more about them](http://intermediaarts.org/about/)) and I think the [Minnedemo](http://minnedemo.org/)/[Minnebar](http://barcamp.org/MinneBar) community should show its support with some donations.

I really enjoyed the last Minnedemo (at the same venue). It is a great chance to connect with a great group of local developers, entrepreneurs and a wide variety of other people -- each of them very interesting!

Hope to see you there!

#### Update - January 25th

I didn't do a goodÂ enough job looking through my calendar. It turns out we are going to be heading out of town on the morning on February 6th for a ski weekend up north. I'm going to miss this Minnedemo. Bummer. Hope everyone else has a great time!
