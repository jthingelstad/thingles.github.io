If you are a friend of mine on Facebook you are going to see a lot fewer updates from me going forward. I've decided to no longer send [Twitter](http://twitter.com/) updates to [my Facebook profile](http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=605776057).

I was having a [great lunch](http://www.cueatguthrie.com/) with my friend [Jim Bernard](http://www.jimbernard.net/) and he had mentioned that he had severed the Twitter-Facebook bridge and I was curious. He explained to me his reasoning and much of it rung true to me. I also reflected on feedback I got from people that I know on Facebook and they were commenting that I updated a lot, usually with a note of annoyance. The reality was I used Twitter a decent amount, and I never do Facebook updates.

Twitter was one of the early applications deployed when Facebook opened up their platform to third parties. I quickly added it and never thought much about it. Plus, at that time, the people I had connections with on Facebook were largely the same people that I had connections with on Twitter. So it seemed to make sense to just mirror things.

That has changed a lot. Facebook is a very different community than Twitter. There is a lot less overlap between my social network on Facebook than Twitter. Twitter users expect a different volume of updates, and have a wider range of context for those updates. Lastly, sending a lot of Tweets to Facebook just creates a lot of noise. The two systems have different cultures: **Twitter is a hot tub, Facebook is a high school reunion**.

If you want to still get my Twitter updates, you can [follow me on Twitter](http://twitter.com/thingles). If we aren't friends on Facebook, check out [my profile page](http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=605776057). I will continue to syndicate my blog posts to my Facebook profile.
