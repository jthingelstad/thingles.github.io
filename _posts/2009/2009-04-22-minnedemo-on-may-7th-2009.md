The next [Minnedemo](http://minnedemo.org/) is now scheduled for May 7, 2009 at 6:00pm. It is free (as always), but registration is required so [get signed up](http://minnedemo.eventbrite.com/). There are 324 open tickets left at this point.
I'm a big fan of Minnedemo and find it a great place to connect with people and hear about some of the products and cool projects everyone is working on. Hope to see you there!

It seems the best way to stay updated on Minnedemo dates and news is via the [Minnebar Twitter account](http://twitter.com/minnebar).
