Earlier this month we went "up north" and spent the weekend at [Giant's Ridge](http://giantsridge.com/) with our friends the [Tangen's](http://www.thetangens.net/). A fun time was had by all but Tammy was the only one that really knew how to ski. Kent and I did a morning in ski lessons and then worked up the courage to go down the real hills. The kids had a great time going down the bunny hill and back up on the "magic carpet". The whole weekend felt a bit retro, and that was the inspiration for the video I put together.
