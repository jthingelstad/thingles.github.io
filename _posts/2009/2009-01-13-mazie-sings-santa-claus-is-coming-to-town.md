Mazie really got into Christmas this year. It made Christmas so much more fun for me this year just to see the excitement and enthusiasm she had for the big day. She started to sing along to some of the Christmas Music we had playing and were singing to ourselves and really got into [Santa Claus is Coming to Town](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Claus_is_Coming_to_Town).
Shortly after Christmas she picked up her guitar and gave her own rendition. Cutest video ever. :-)
