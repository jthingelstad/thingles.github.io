I would really like to get out and do some fun shooting but would love to find some new spots that have a lot of interesting stuff going on. The Stone Arch bridge is obvious, something a little less obvious. I was thinking that the Midtown Global Market would be a fun place, but it's inside and fairly dark. Would need a really fast lens, but could get some cool shots.
Anyone want to share some favorite places for photography? If your interested in a photowalk, let me know!
