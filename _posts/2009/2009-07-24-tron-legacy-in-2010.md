This is a couple of minute [preview from the upcoming Tron Legacy](http://www.flynnlives.com/media/video/0xendgame.aspx) to be [released in 2010](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1104001/), released today. It's a great clip.

I watched this preview in awe. I was one of the kids that saw [Tron](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084827/) when I was just 10 years old and was amazed by it. It reinforced my amazement with the computers. I may have even thrown glow-in-the-dark frisbees at friends of mine in the middle of the night, pretending we were in the disc war game of Tron. Maybe.

I can't wait to see this new one.
