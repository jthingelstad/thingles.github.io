This week we said goodbye to one of the most distinctive art features of our house. In January of 2003 Tammy's longtime friend [Liane McMeen](http://www.mnartists.org/artistHome.do?rid=9421) painted a great mural in our living room that surrounded a piece of art that we got in Denver featuring a dog positioned in a Volkswagen Bug door. For over 6 years when people have come into our house and turned the corner to enter the main living area, they've been greeted by a very large mural that put a smile on their face and welcomed them to our house. It set the tone of our house: fun, lighthearted, happy.
As much as we liked the mural, we decided that it was time for a change, and that the mural should be retired. We celebrated with a dinner at our house with Liane and her husband Chris. Just this week the actual paint went up and the mural is gone. Some wonderful new pieces of art have gone up in the spot.

In memory of this great gift, I decided to do a new version of the [original time-lapse video](/thingelstad/blue-dog-mural) I did when the mural was put up, with some new photos on the end.

I put in the [post 6 years ago](/thingelstad/blue-dog-mural) that "We live with all of our art, but this is part of every day." That couldn't be more true. Thanks again to Liane! We still have the Blue Dog sculpture but it has been moved to a different spot in the house.
