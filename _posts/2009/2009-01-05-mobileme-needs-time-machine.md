I'm frustrated with [MobileMe](http://www.me.com/) synchronizing again. I have no idea what happened but around 10:00 am this morning my Address Book has a duplicate everything. All the groups are duplicated, and every contact is duplicated. They are identical, with one exception, the pictures. So now I have 2x the real number of entries and they are all whacky. These are all rolled down to my iPhone already too.
Now, I can get back to healthy pretty easy with Time Machine and I've also started doing a weekly archive of my Address Book "just in case", but I thought syncing for MobileMe was supposed to be [improved in 10.5.6](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3194)?

This made me think, Apple needs to implement Time Machine on MobileMe. I should be able to just login to MobileMe and go back to a few hours and make it all better! MobileMe and Time Machine would be like chocolate and peanut butter. Makes total sense.
