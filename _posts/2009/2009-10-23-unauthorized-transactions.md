This morning when I checked my email I found many more unread messages than typical. A bit concerned, I found many [PayPal](http://www.paypal.com/) messages.

That isn't a great way to start the day. You see, I have no idea who "NC Interactive, Inc." is. Additionally, I can tell you that at that time I was fast asleep getting a good nights rest. Ugh!

It seems that someone got access to my account and decided to buy some credits for an online game. Each transaction was between $39 and $59. There were 16 transactions totaling nearly a $1,000 of fraudulent charges.

After seeing this I immediately changed my password as well as my secret question answers. I filed these transactions as fraudulent and I'm assuming that this will be easy to get PayPal to reverse. However, they say it will take about a week to get it resolved.

I wonder if the criminal just stopped using it after $1,000? The charges stopped a couple of hours before I noticed it and changed the password. They didn't seem to do anything further in my account either.

In years of using PayPal, and generally just doing commerce on the web, this is the first time I've gotten hit with any fraudulent activity. I guess my luck ran out.
