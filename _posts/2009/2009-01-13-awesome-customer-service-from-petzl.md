[![Petzl Logo]({{ site.url }}/assets/posts/2009/petzl-logo.png)](http://www.petzl.com/)When you buy outdoor equipment there is always a stark difference in price between the store brand, entry-level products and the premium outdoor versions. The promise behind that premium price is a level of customer service that understands that you are getting this gear to use it, and they will stand behind it in real-world usage.
A few years ago I got my father-in-law a [Petzl Zipka Plus](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000EI9BG/?tag=thingelstad-20) headlamp and he's used it a good amount. He mentioned a few weeks ago that he had slipped outside and the headlamp had popped off his head and hit some rocks at just the right angle. The lamp still worked, but the case was badly cracked making it vulnerable to water, and the retracting mechanism was completely destroyed. We figured he probably just needed a new one, but I wanted to give customer support at Petzl a shot.

I realized this was out of warranty, and even if it was in the warranty period the situation wasn't something I would expect them to cover. I emailed customer support and they got back to me right away and suggested I send the lamp in and they would take a look at it. They got it, proactively notified me of the status of the repair, did the repair and sent it back in a couple of weeks.

I was really impressed with how well they stood behind their product. It's refreshing to see companies live up to their premium promise. Way to go [Petzl](http://www.petzl.com/)! Thank you!
