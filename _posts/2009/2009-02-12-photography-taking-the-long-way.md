When I was getting ready to go up to [Wintergreen](http://www.dogsledding.com/) for [my dog sledding trip]({{site.url}}{% link _posts/2009/2009-01-11-im-going-dog-sledding-with-my-camera.md %}) I was talking with my friend [Jim](http://www.jimbernard.net/) about the trip and he told me there were two things I had to do. First, I needed to check out the two papers in [Ely](http://www.ely.org/). Ely is a small town, but they have two vibrant newspapers and they have a spirited back-and-forth between the two. I enjoyed reading the [Echo](http://www.elyecho.com/) and the [Timberjay](http://timberjay.com/) on the couch at Wintergreen on my first day. _As an aside, if you are looking for a little Ely love, go to [WELY's website](http://www.wely.com/) and start streaming the local radio station. It's awesome. I'm listening to it right now as I type this._
Jim's second recommendation was that I take "the best road in Minnesota" while I was up there. The "fast way" to get to Ely is to [take I-35 North and then head up on 33/53/37/169](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=minneapolis,+mn+to+ely,+mn&sll=47.386728,-92.363434&sspn=0.493247,0.577469&ie=UTF8&z=8). The "slow way", which is about 90 minutes longer, is to [take I-35 North and go through Duluth, take the scenic drive on the North Shore, and then Highway 1 to Ely](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=minneapolis,+mn&daddr=47.282956,-91.230469+to:ely,+mn&hl=en&geocode=&mra=dpe&mrcr=0&mrsp=1&sz=8&via=1&sll=46.392411,-92.559814&sspn=4.019776,4.619751&ie=UTF8&ll=46.392411,-92.559814&spn=4.019776,4.619751&z=8). On the way to Ely, I took the fast way. On the way home, I decided to put my camera with a couple of lenses in the passenger seat and head down Highway 1. It was great, and there were a lot of photography stops. Here are my [pictures on the Long Way Home](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jthingelstad//sets/72157613732639278).
