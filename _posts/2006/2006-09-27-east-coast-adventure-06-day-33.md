On Tuesday we loaded up in the van and headed for a short drive to Savannah, Georgia. Drive more? Absolutely! Why not... we just can't get enough driving. Savannah is such a notable city and we thought since we were so close we should check it out. It took about 2 hours to get there.

Savannah is a really nice city. It's smaller than the others we've been to. We didn't have a ton of time so we drove through many of the parkways and then headed into the historic area of downtown.

We had lunch at [The Lady & Sons](http://www.ladyandsons.com/) restaurant. This is the restaurant that Paula Deen started before becoming the celebrity chef on Food TV. The Lady & Sons is best described as a **Temple to Butter**. The food is stunningly rich. As you sit there with biscuits immediately delivered to your table, you can envision truckloads of butter being constantly delivered to the loading dock to keep the cooks going. At one point while we are eating lunch one of the waitresses breaks out into song to praise frying! "I don't want no grilled fish" went the lyrics, finishing with "give me my fried chicken and fried gravy".

We spent the afternoon in Forsyth Park and took a bunch of pictures before heading out and returning to Charleston.
