Being a dad rocks.

That pretty much sums it up. I could just end this comment now and be done. Dad's that are reading it would understand. In fact, the openness of the statement is ideal as you can consider all that individual greatness of being a dad with your kids.

This year was my 2nd fathers day. It's fun that Mazie's birthday is right before fathers day. It makes for a better day as you are already celebrating how awesome it is that your child has grown more and more.

Mazie is so cool. She's a pro walker now, rarely falling or getting tripped up. She even does pretty well on uneven surfaces with actual shoes on. She's really verbal. She ranges from her version of dog, banana, gypsie, logan, mom, dad to her tendency to be, as Tammy and I put it, squaky.

She is a strong willed kid. She knows exactly what she wants to eat, in what order, and will clearly communicate it to you. She has started to play games with me. She'll pretend like she's going to come to me and turns away at the last minute giggling. Simply put, it's pretty awesome to watch this little girl growing up.

Being a dad is a pretty great thing. I realize that it's so much easier than the mom side of the fence. No being pregnant. No delivery. No breastfeeding. Even the things that are shared, this dad gets the easy route on. I change a tenth of the diapers Tammy does. The hardest thing I do is going away on business trips, but I credit that away time with making me truly appreciate the wonder that is my kid.

I love my kid. I love my wife. I love being a dad.
