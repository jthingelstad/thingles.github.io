[![]({{ site.url }}/assets/posts/2006/o_WRT300N.jpg)](http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?c=L_Product_C2&childpagename=US%2FLayout&cid=1144763513404&pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FVisitorWrapper)While getting the Internet side of life setup while on the **Great Adventure** I made a trip to [Best Buy](http://www.bestbuy.com/) to get a wireless router. The apartment has broadband (of course), but it terminated to a single ethernet cable and being tethered to a desk with only one laptop simply wasn't acceptable. I've got my two laptops here, plus the work one, and sofa computing is a must.

I really debated at the store. I grabbed a [WRT54GS](http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?c=L_Product_C2&childpagename=US%2FLayout&cid=1148435315453&pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FVisitorWrapper) and was going to walk out but I already have a [WRT54G](http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?c=L_Product_C2&childpagename=US%2FLayout&cid=1149562300349&pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FVisitorWrapper) at home and it seemed lame to get something with nothing new at all. So, I decided to jump into the world of [802.11n](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/802.11#802.11n) with the [WRT300N](http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?c=L_Product_C2&childpagename=US%2FLayout&cid=1144763513404&pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FVisitorWrapper). On top of it? It has a super cool antennae array on top. ;-)

I also grabbed a 802.11n PCMCIA card for my laptop, [WPC300N](http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?c=L_Product_C2&childpagename=US%2FLayout&cid=1144763513196&pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FVisitorWrapper), and I'm all up and running. Of course, I have no local servers here that can actually test the speed that I now have, but it will come in handy at home since I've found even [802.11g](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/802.11#802.11g) to be too slow for mutlimedia content or even RAW digital photos.

The setup was simple on the WRT300N, no complaints. The chassis is the same as the WRT54G with a nicer front facia. It also comes with a clip so that you can side mount it.

I did miss the opportunity though to get a router that would support IPsec and allow me to build a VPN tunnel back to the home network in Minneapolis via the ZyWall. It would have been cool, but there wasn't a clear option in the price range I was willing to jump into.
