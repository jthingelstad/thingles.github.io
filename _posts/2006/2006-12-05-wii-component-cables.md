My component cables arrived for the Wii today. I finally was able to move off the incredibly lame composite connection and [480i](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/480i) to a nice crisp component connection and [480p](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/480p). I know that this is a much better setup, and I eagerly plugged it in and decided to get my camera out and do some before/after comparisons. While I can tell the difference, it's not as striking as I expected.
<!-- more --> These shots are all taken from the Wii menu screen. I took photos of the "disc" channel and of the Mii channel. I also took a photo of the Wii settings button on the lower left corner of the screen. See what you think.

You can tell that the progressive scan smooths out the fonts a bit.

Great example that when you are not "super-zoomed" into the image, you can't really tell much of a difference.

This extreme zoom shows the best the differences between the two settings.

There are [other write-ups about the component cables](http://www.lawrenceingraham.com/?p=38) that show the differences as well.
