This site showed up in one of my RSS feeds recently, [How Many of Me?](http://www.howmanyofme.com/search/) It is a fun little site that takes census data to do rankings of people with the same name. For example, did you realize there are [49,535 people with the name John Smith](http://ww2.howmanyofme.com/search/?given=john&sur=smith). That is bigger than my [home town](http://web.ci.minot.nd.us/). You could fill a medium sized city with John Smiths.
According to the census data, there are no people in the US with the last name Thingelstad. There are however [328,466 people with the first name Jamie](http://ww2.howmanyofme.com/search/?given=jamie&sur=thingelstad). Of those people, 69.86% of them are female. This is something that Tammy loves to tease me about all the time, even before she had the hard data to back it up. This usually presents itself as me paying at a restaurant and the waiter not knowing who to give the card back to.

My name is the 182nd most popular first name. While [Tammy's name](http://ww2.howmanyofme.com/search/?given=tammy&sur=thingelstad) is compltely unambiguous -- 100% of Tammy's are women -- her name is 144th most popular so not quite as creative. Of course her actual name, [Tamara](http://ww2.howmanyofme.com/search/?given=tamara&sur=thingelstad), is much less popular ranking 421st. However, we know from [Name Voyager](http://babynamewizard.com/namevoyager/lnv0105.html) that neither Jamie or Tamara (Tammy) were creative for their time since they peaked in popularity when we were born.

Mazie enjoys a very rare name. There are only [4,500 Mazie's in the US](http://ww2.howmanyofme.com/search/?given=mazie&sur=thingelstad) (100% are female) and it's the 2,762nd most popular name.

Isn't the Internet so much fun? :-)
