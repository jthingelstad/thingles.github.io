Minneapolis is becoming a much cooler place to be a techie geek, startup business sort of guy. Thanks to the hard work of a very small group of people last year Minneapolis had it's first ever minnebar. [MinneBar](http://barcamp.org/MinneBar) is a [BarCamp](http://barcamp.org/) event, also known as an "unconference". The idea is simple, a bunch of people of like interests (in this case all things geek) convene on one spot and self-organize into a worthwhile conference. It's like [wiki](http://wiki.org/wiki.cgi?WhatIsWiki) meets conference.

Anyway, the 2nd edition of the more frequent and shorter [minnedemo](http://barcamp.org/MinneDemo) has been scheduled for December 11th at Acadia Cafe.

[Minnedemo](http://barcamp.org/MinneDemo) is different than minnebar in that it's shorter, somewhat more social, and features short demos rather than longer form presentations. I missed the first one due to a business trip, but I'm definitely going to be at the 2nd edition!

Check it out, sign up, and meet some great people. Plus, [Road Sign Math](http://www.roadsignmath.com/) is a sponsor. :-)
