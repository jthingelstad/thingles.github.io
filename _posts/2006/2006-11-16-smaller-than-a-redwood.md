Tammy has launched her website, Smaller Than a Redwood. You should check it out. Her website is finding it's groove right now. She's got some early content on it. She doesn't intend it to be "diary based" like this site. You won't see what we did when and where on it, but instead different thoughts and comments that she wants to put up. She is also looking to put content from her friends on it as well.
The name of the site came from a conversation Tammy was having with Ann as she was preparing for a trip to San Francisco and the Redwood Forest. She has an assignment to write something for the site while sitting under the Redwoods.

Her site is pretty fun!
