It seems amazing that in only 3 more months Mazie will turn 1! She is doing great. She has recovered from her 2nd real cold with lots of coughing and sneezing, and most notably plenty of running nose. An almost never-ending amount actually. She's decided she likes baby food and we think she has her 2nd set of teeth coming in since she's been eating her hand pretty much constantly lately.

She's turning into such a little kid now. She likes to babble at you for a while and will share some stories with you. They are pretty short still, but it's just amazing to hear her voice and particularly to hear her giggle.

We had a trip to Ikea this weekend and Mazie and I had a great time while Tammy shopped with our friends Lisa and Eric who were in town for the weekend. All sorts of fun to be had at Ikea.

Mazie has chosen to stay fairly immobile thus far. She's not crawling, and from the looks of things she is likely to just skip that whole process. She doesn't like being on her belly at all. She does love it though if you hold her hands and let her walk around the house or around stores. She finds that to be a great old time. She can scoot around pretty well and can make it all over her play area.

I'm itching for spring to come and for us to be able to spend more time outside. We ordered a bike carrier/jogging stroller ([Chariot Cougar 2](http://www.chariotcarriers.com/html_english/cougar2.htm) if you are interested, I'll post impressions of it after we get it).

I put up a whole bunch of pictures from January and February. Don't miss the pictures of her in the bowl.
