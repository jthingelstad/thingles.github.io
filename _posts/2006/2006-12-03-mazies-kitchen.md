I got to play **Super Dad** today and put together Mazie's christmas present. December 3rd? Sure -- she's 18 months old -- it's Christmas! :-)
Tammy and I got her a "kitchen thing" for Christmas and have coordinated with her Grandparents, Aunts, Uncles and other relatives to get presents that go along with it.

The kitchen came in 4 boxes, with lots of assembly required. Just a bunch of peices of wood. Tammy suggested that she put it together while I was in NY last week. I thought about that for a moment, and I didn't like it. Assembling the "assembly required" Christmas present is a Dad job for sure -- and I didn't want to be deprived of my fatherhood rights.

I got a bit frustrated at the beginning. Not too frustrated though, I'm pretty sure my language was clean the entire time. I put every joint together with added wood glue. This thing will be around for generations to come. She is having fun with it and it will be nice for her to get her pots and pans and other accessories to go with it.
