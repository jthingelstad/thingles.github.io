![1635199](/assets/posts/{{ page.date | date: "%Y" }}/the_earth_is_1635199.gif)I recently decided that I needed to re-read this book as well. Similar to [A Walk in the Woods](/thingelstad/a-walk-in-the-woods), I'd been reminiscing about what a great book this was when I read it a few years ago, and then found myself reading all the [Harry Middleton books](http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/results.asp?ath=Harry+Middleton) that there were. His style of writing is unique, and has a pace that some would find frustrating, but I found relaxing and broadly enjoyable. In many ways he reminds me of [Norman MacLean](http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/results.asp?ath=Norman+MacLean), and that is a pretty big compliment.

Earth is Enough is a book about living life simply. It is the recounting of Middleton's boyhood years living with his uncles in the mountains. It brings out the beauty in the simple, and the wonderment of the basic qualities of life. The cast of characters in the book are larger than life, and all have a lessen to tell.

This is a truly wonderful read, as are the other books in the series (Bright Country, On the Spine of Time). I think this is one that you get more out of every time you read it. And please remember to slow down and enjoy it.
