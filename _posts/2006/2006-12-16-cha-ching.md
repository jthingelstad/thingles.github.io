[![piggy.png](/assets/posts/2006/piggy1.png)](http://www.midnightapps.com/chaching/)The other night while catching up on my RSS feeds in [Reader](http://reader.google.com/) I stumbled upon a small software project for the Mac called [Cha-Ching](http://www.midnightapps.com/chaching/). Cha-Ching is a product from Midnight Apps that intends to take on the personal finance heavyweights like Quicken. It's not open source, but it reminds me of Firefox finally providing real competition for the lagging Internet Explorer 6.0 and pushing innovation in the market, and this is a market that needs innovation.
Cha-Ching is far from being able to supplant Quicken, but it's sleek and well done. It feels enjoyable to use, and at only version 0.4 there is much to hope for. My hopes are with the Midnight Apps crew to build a product that will have elegance and simplicity, with rich and powerful features.
