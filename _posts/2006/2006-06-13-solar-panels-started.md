Our solar heat project completed today! Just before 2:00 pm today [Innovative Power Systems](http://www.ips-solar.com/) turned on the collectors and started to bring heat down to the storage tank. I'm monitoring the system and collecting data with [Cacti](http://www.cacti.net/). Below is a graph showing the temperature of the water that is coming back from the panels (this is one of several data points I'm monitoring on the system). The water coming back reached a maximum of 138 degrees and the panels themselves were about 145 degrees.

I'm really excited to have this project done. Not least of which is that it's been 8 months since we made the decision to do it. I've been really surprised (but pleased!) at how many people have asked me about this project so I am going to write-up a thorough post about "My Solar Experience" and post it in the coming days. I'm very encouraged that some of you may consider to start tapping into renewable energy as well.

I have to go check my graphs again. :-)
