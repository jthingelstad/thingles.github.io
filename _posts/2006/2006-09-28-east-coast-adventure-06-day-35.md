It's official! We have just finished the 5th week our trip. This was our last true day of vacation here in Charleston. We will hit the road early tomorrow heading through Atlanta with a brief stop at the Atlanta aquarium and then continuing our long journey home.
We got rained out in the morning today on our visit to the [Boone Hall Plantation](http://www.boonehallplantation.com/). Boone Hall is the only plantation still operating in America, they grow fruit now. It also has one of the most amazing entrances I've ever seen.

The oak trees that line the drive are 300 years old and were planted when the plantation was initially founded. It took them 200 years to meet in the middle. We didn't get to see a lot since it was raining, but it was a cool visit.

We took the afternoon to join the local residents in a very popular activity -- walking over the relatively new [Ravenel bridge](http://ravenelbridge.net/) that connects Charleston and Mt. Pleasant. This bridge is the longest cable span bridge in the US. It's also incredibly high and has a walking path on it. We walked up to the middle and then turned back. I have to admit that my fear of heights kicked in towards the top. I made it all the way though. It's pretty surprising how many people go just to walk on this bridge. There are always people walking or riding their bike on it.

I've decided that this is "my bridge". I find it incredibly interesting. The cable spans are so interesting. The geometry of it is great. I've decided that we need a bridge just like it in Minneapolis. I'm going to start lobbying for it when I return. :-)

Tomorrow morning we depart early for Atlanta and then continue into the evening to see how far we get. We are hoping to get back to home by Saturday night, late. Don't expect any updates from me on the road. I'm looking forward to getting back home again!
