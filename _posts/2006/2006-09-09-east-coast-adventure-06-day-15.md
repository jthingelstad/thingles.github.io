Friday! Whew... I'm not usually one to get super excited about the week ending but this one can go away. Busy really doesn't fully or accurately describe the frenetic pace of the week. I've learned a lesson with this trip. Since I had been planning for so long to have these three weeks in the office I chucked it full of all sorts of critical things that I wanted to do in person. I didn't leave enough gaps. Add on top of that other fire drills that come up and I really put myself in a hyperactive state.
If I do this again, lesson: Leave plenty of unscheduled, unstructured time to work with people and deal with the unexpected.
