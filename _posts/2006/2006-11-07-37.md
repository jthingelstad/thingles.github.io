I had a busy day on election day with an 8am meeting at work. I was determined to get out and vote and I ended up being the 37th vote in my polling station. This is the line that formed right before the polls open.

Voting went smooth. I was leering at the scanner that read my votes after watching the [Hacking Democracy](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-7236791207107726851&sourceid=docidfeed&hl=en-CA) documentary. The software that runs these machines is frightening, the documentary is worth a watch. If there was ever a problem that was well suited for the Internet, it's voting!
