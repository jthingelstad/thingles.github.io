[![](/assets/posts/2006/o_inconvenienttruth.jpg)](http://www.climatecrisis.net/)It likely isn't going to come as a surprise to anyone that the people who are currently finishing an installation of solar heat were at the opening showing of [An Inconvenient Truth](http://www.climatecrisis.net/) last night. I heard about this movie a few weeks ago and I've been eager to see it since.

Let me cut straight to the point: **You really need to see this movie**. Did you get that? I mean it. Go see this movie. I don't care if you are republican or democrat, liberal or conservative, green or blue. Just go see it.

Calling [An Inconvenient Truth](http://www.climatecrisis.net/) a movie seems a little wrong, it's really more like going to see a presentation. And you understand why fairly quickly. Al Gore has been giving this presentation on global warming for a long time, but one person can only be in so many places. The movie is a great way to get the message out to millions of people, and it is done very well.

I like to think that even skeptics of global warming will leave the theatre with a new perspective. I'm not going to try to summarize it here as I just wouldn't do as good of a job. Go check it out -- soon!
