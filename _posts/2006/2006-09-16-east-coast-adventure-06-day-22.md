This was the last week in New Jersey and we began preparation for the last two weeks of vacation. Grandma Kaye and Aunt Angie were out through Wednesday which was great. They were all able to do stuff during the day while I was at the office and everyone had a lot of fun. Angie took something like 230 pictures just to prove the point!

This final week was the most "normal" of the weeks. I didn't have any all day meetings, or any business dinners. It was nice to rev down just a little bit and Tammy was happy to see me in the evenings a bit earlier. The week wrapped up at work and we are leaving our 800 square feet two bedroom and heading on vacation now.
