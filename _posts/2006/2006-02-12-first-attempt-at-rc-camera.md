Yesterday I received my recent order from [Helidirect](http://www.helidirect.com/), a [wireless video camera](http://www.helidirect.com/product_info.php?cPath=72&products_id=795). This little toy is to be put on-board of various radio control things to record video from the car, helicopter or whatever. I gave it a run for the money today, the results weren"t great, but I"m encouraged that it can get much better. Feel free to jump to the videos right away.

I have to figure some things out. First of all, the [E-Sky Llama](http://www.helidirect.com/product_info.php?cPath=29&products_id=594) was almost impossible to fly with the 27g of the video camera and the 9v battery strapped to it. It did get off the ground, but it took a lot of force. The [T-Rex](http://www.helidirect.com/product_info.php?cPath=29&products_id=1001) I just ordered wont suffer this problem, but as it is, not really flyable to any extent. The other issue was my mount on both helicopter and my nitro car. I just slapped it on there which didn"t work so hot. First of all, the car throws a lot of force around and the 9v battery flew off the car. On the heli, there is a lot of vibration that messes with the picture. I also think I need to deal with interference off of the electric motor.

I plan on working on this a bit. Need to develop a real mount that attaches to the car/heli for real, along with a battery carrier. I"m hopeful that will get rid of a lot of the video noise.
