I wrote earlier that Mazie was having a horrible time getting her sleep. Asheville was the breaking point for Tammy and I. We were like zombies, Mazie was miserable and incredibly unhappy. We finally went to a different hotel the last night and Mazie was able to sleep. The good news is that she slept great at Ed & Nancy's, and she's been doing great here in Charleston.

She's slept through the night and went to bed well for the last 5 days and is doing great. It's amazing how big of a help that is to all of us. Yeah!
