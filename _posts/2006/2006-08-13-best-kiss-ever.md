Mazie is growing up so fast. She's such an amazing kid. For the last couple of months if I asked she would come over and give me a kiss on the cheek. Well this weekend she decided all on her own she was going to give her dad a kiss! Man was that awesome. I was holding her and she comes around and gives me a smack on the cheek. I'm still beaming!

She's doing really great. I can tell that she's trying to learn how to deal with stairs which has her, at times, over-protective dad freaking out. I'm constantly lurching to grab her as she approaches anything resembling a stair. She's doing a lot better walking along with me -- she stays with me well for as long as a block only wandering off a little bit.

She is also starting to talk more and more. She's figured out "help". If she gets into a tough spot walking around, or wants something off of a counter, she will ask mom or I for "help". She's got "dog" or "cat" down well, including a very convincing "meow".

She just gets better and better, and being Mazie's dad is the best job I have. :-)
