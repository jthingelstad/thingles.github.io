We got Mazie's next car seat today, a [Britax Marathon](http://www.britaxusa.com/products.cfm?action=ShowProduct&pro_id=7C71C785-4FBA-422D-83DC419B3D5B8213). They had a sporting pink one with flowers all over it, but we went for the more neutral and car appropriate (oh, and washable) version.

Mazie tried it out at the store and she loved it, or at least she didn't yell at us right away. She is big enough now that she can use the bigger car seats but not too big for her infant seat, so we've still been using that. I've been thinking that she finds it annoying and wants to move up to the real car seat and stroller combination. That way she can sit up and see more things. She's always craning her head around trying to look at things. I'd find it annoying at least.

Mazie is finally over her cold. Just some minor sniffles at this point. Tammy and I were able to catch it before she fought it off. Luckily we are able to blow our nose and have cough drops.
