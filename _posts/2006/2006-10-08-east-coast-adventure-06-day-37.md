On September 30, 2006 our Great East Coast Adventure came to a conclusion when we arrived back home on Saturday evening. After **37 days**, **5,890 miles** of driving and **8 different beds** we finally got home. It was great trip, but it was equally great to finally get home and relax.

We were curious to see how Mazie would react when we got home. 5 weeks is a long time for a 15-month old kid and we thought she may just think it was another hotel. She proved us wrong when her face lit up after seein her toys and play area. You could tell she was noticably relaxed to be home.

I did a final update to the [Google Earth Great Adventure](http://thingelstad.com/s/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/great-adventure.kmz) with all the relevant interesting stops from the trip.
