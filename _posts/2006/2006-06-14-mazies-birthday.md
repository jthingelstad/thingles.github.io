Hello, Tammy here.  It was Mazie's first birthday today!  Whee...  I have been looking forward to this day since before she was born.  I finally have a kid that's one.  I don't know why that matters, but to me it is a big milestone.  Jamie took the day off of work to help celebrate.  There were pancakes and a visit from the neighbors and our favorite landscaper, a trip to the beach where Mazie found her sea legs in preparation for her pirate party on Saturday, lunch with my mom, her friend and her friend's granddaughter, and then off to the Minnesota Zoo.  Mazie thought that all of the animals at the zoo were interesting, but the pigs were her favorite.  I think she fancied the snorts and other fun noises they made. 

After Mazie hit the sack, Jamie and I headed over to our neighbor's house for an evening of ART!  We met a local artist that our neighbors know, saw and helped in the hanging of the really cool paintings that they purchased from him, and had lots of fun talking and looking at art.  It was a great way for the two of us to celebrate the passing of our first year with little Mazie.  

Thanks to everyone who emailed, called, visited and sent Miss Mazie birthday wishes.  She very much appreciated all of the love that she felt today.  Mazie's first birthday rocked!  Jamie uploaded some of the pictures from the day which include several shots of Mazie wearing her fabulous birthday hat.

Tammy over and OUT
