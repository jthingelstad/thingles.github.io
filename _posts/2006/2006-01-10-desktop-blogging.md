I may be in a minority of people running a web site and still creating content by typing into a web page. I've decided to get "with it" and try a desktop blogging client. I'm giving [BlogJet](http://blogjet.com/) and [Post2Blog](http://www.bytescout.com/post2blog.html) a run. They have some wonderful features, one of the key selling points being the ability for me to easily attach images and other binary objects and have it automatically uploaded to another hosting provider. The other big win is that I can write things offline and upload them later. We'll see if I think it's worth the (low) cost, but so far so good.

I also looked at [w.bloggar](http://www.wbloggar.com/), but it's just not as slick as either of these two tools.
