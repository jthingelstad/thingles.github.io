So yesterday when I got home from work Mazie was having dinner and she was really sick. She didn't seem nearly as sick when I went to work. She had a full-blown cold. She woke up this morning not feeling any better.

She has had a cold before, when she was very small. It wasn't that big of a deal -- runny nose and some mild coughing. This one is different though. This is her first, **real** cold. Nose is going crazy. She's super-congested. Coughing stuff up. And I'll tell you it's killing me!

This morning I gave her a bath while Tammy was at the gym and after the bath, which I think she sort of liked with the cold and all, she would cough and then wimper. I could tell her chest was hurting when she was coughing. And what could I do? Zip. I just held her and she hung out with me a lot less excitable than she usually was. To prove the point, when Tammy got back from the gym Mazie just hung out with me and didn't feel a need to jump into Tammy's arms as fast as she possibly could (as is typical).

I sure hope she gets better soon. I don't know how much of this I can take!
