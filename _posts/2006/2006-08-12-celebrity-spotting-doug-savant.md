We are all in Iowa City this weekend to see our friends Lisa & Eric and particularly their new baby girl Rachel. She's as cute as can be and so tiny! I know Mazie was that tiny, but I have no real recollection of it.

[![](http://i.imdb.com/Photos/Events/3828/th-DougSavant_Grani_6421752_400.jpg)](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0767443/)We are staying at the [Hotel Vetro](http://www.hotelvetro.com/), which is an overly hip hotel for Iowa City and while going to the elevator today Tammy saw someone in the hallway she was positive she knew. She stopped the guy while telling me "Isn't that someone we know?" I looked at it wasn't, but it was one of the actors from [Desperate Housewives](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0410975/), [Doug Savant](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0767443/).

I checked online and [his wife](http://www.tv.com/laura-leighton/person/6313/biography.html) is from Iowa City so I would guess they were here visiting.
