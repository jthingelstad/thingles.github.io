I recently got my after-Christmas Christmas present. What's that? Well, if I had something on my list and I didn't happen to get it, I thought I should clean up that list. We don't want to have things sitting on their forever now right?!

A few weeks ago I decided I wanted to get a pair of binoculars. The primary use is for looking at wildlife around our house, and checking out birds. I'm sure that every time I mention bird watching I lose 10% of the audience to this website. Anyway, it is fun. The last use is for astronomical viewing. When out with the telescope, it's nice to have a pair of binoculars to do some viewing.

The binoc's you want for birding are completely different than those you want for astronomy, so I compromised with more emphasis on wildlife. I decided to get the [Canon 12x36 IS II](http://consumer.usa.canon.com/ir/controller?act=ModelDetailAct&fcategoryid=128&modelid=9836), mainly for the image stabilization. I got them a few days ago and it is very impressive.

The image stabilization works wonders. I was testing them and I could easily read text on objects far away with the image stabilization engaged. Without it, it was just too jumpy. I also find that I don't get queezy when looking through them as I often do with binoc's.

They are small, compact, lightweight, have a great grippy feel. I'm very pleased thus far. They run on a pair of AA batteries.
