I've got a bunch of little USB flash drives hanging around. It is almost as if they rain from the sky. In fact, if you go to a trade show, they sometimes in fact do! I had a new requirement of a flash drive recently though. I wanted to actually run an application off of it. Up to now I've used them like a "cool" floppy disk. But now I wanted to actually put a program on it and run it from an Windows machine I walked up to. The software worked in this mode, but, to my dismay the flash drives I had were horrible at this.

Pathetic performance is documented below on one of my 1G flash cards.

Of course this problem is easily solved with a credit card and a few clicks on [Newegg](http://www.newegg.com/). I ordered the [OCZ Rally2 2G accelerated](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16820227112) drive, and solved all of my problems.

It is still no hard drive, but, the performance is very acceptable. And to boot, it's nicely packaged with a metal enclosure and no wasted room.
