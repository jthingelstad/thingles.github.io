Two weekends ago Mazie really started to walk. She'd been able to take a step or two for a while, but while we were in Lanesboro on the Olson Family trip she "took off" and decided she was mobile. In the last two weeks she's gotten pretty good at it and now pretty much demands on walking on her own. Here is a video of her walking at the [Minnesota Landscape Arboretum](http://www.arboretum.umn.edu/). (Excuse the video quality, it was taken with my Canon S500 camera in movie mode, with a shaky hand.)
