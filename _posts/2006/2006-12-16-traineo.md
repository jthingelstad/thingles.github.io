[![traineo](http://www.traineo.com/images/traineo.gif)](http://www.traineo.com/)While reading [TechCrunch](http://www.techcrunch.com/) about a week ago I saw a headline about a ["web 2.0" community-centric fitness site](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/12/08/web-app-provides-virtual-fitness-support/) called [Traineo](http://www.traineo.com/). This hit all my hot buttons since the "geekery" sounded cool and I'm looking for something to help me along my path to getting smaller again. A couple of days later I finally got to the site, signed on and I've been really impressed. I've decided to start using this to track my fitness progress instead of my decade-plus venerable [Lifeform](http://www.lifeform.com/) software. Lifeform is still the best food logging software I've ever seen, but the rest of it I can do it Traineo easier and it's a service with community.

Traineo provides some buttons for you to put on your site and such, you will see one on my site showing my progress towards my weight goal. Of the features that I particularly like is the motivator system where you pick four people that will get weekly reports on your progress.

I'm gushing a bit, the service isn't perfect and I hope to see it improve significantly, but so far I'm really enjoying it. [Check out my profile on Traineo](http://thingles.traineo.com/). If you've been looking for a site to help you with your fitness goals and connect with a community, this is the place to go.
