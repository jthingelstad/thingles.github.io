Today we ventured out of Asheville again and went to [Chimney Rock Park](http://www.chimneyrockpark.com/). The park was pretty cool. We did a short hike to the base of a 400 foot water fall. Mazie did really good in the carrier, although we failed her by not bringing warm enough clothes. We had to bug out pretty quickly since Mazie was cold.

We also went to the [North Carolina Arboretum](http://www.ncarboretum.org/) in the afternoon. It was nice. They had a great bonsai exhibit that I really enjoyed. Mazie enjoyed running around for an extended period of time.

We have moved to a different hotel for this last night in Asheville. This hotel is much better equipped for Mazie and we are hoping she gets a good nights sleep. I _didn't_ need to put tinfoil on the windows here. :-)

Lastly, I updated the [Google Earth](http://earth.google.com/) file with our Asheville adventures. Load the **[Great Adventure KMZ file](http://thingelstad.com/s/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/great-adventure.kmz)** to check out where we've been.
