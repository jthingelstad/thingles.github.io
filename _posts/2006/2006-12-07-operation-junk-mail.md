I've decided enough is enough. Perhaps it's just the holiday season, but our mailbox has been overloaded with mail order catalogs. Sometimes as many as ten a day. It's insane! I've decided to declare a War on Catalogs!

I've had good success so far. I'm going to the website of every company that we get a catalog for and submitting a customer service request. So far most are responding promptly. I'm keeping a list of who I contact, when and any relevant tracking numbers so I can escalate if I need to.

Hopefully our recycling will go down, our mail carrier will be happier, and we'll have less junk thrown in our face to buy.
