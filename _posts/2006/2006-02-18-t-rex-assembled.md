I just spent the last 4 hours assembling my Align T-Rex 450SE. Luckily I got the high-end one that comes 80% pre-assembled. That is why it was 4 hours rather than 40. Man are the parts small. Physically this helicopter is all together, and I've even slapped the electronics on it, but now I need to wire it all up. Time to break out the soldering iron and then start getting it all "setup". That means getting everything just so and finally able to fly with the thing. I expect this process to take close to infinite time. :-)

I'll get another update when I have some breakthrough. I got the Reflex XTR training software for my PC and I'm hoping the actual helicopter is a bit easier to fly than the trainer, or that I had the trainer setup wrong. I crashed over and over and over.

Oh, and I got a new video solution for the remote control stuff. I'll see if I can get a test video out sometime soon.
