Today we left Asheville and headed into the mountains. We drove about 30 miles northwest of Asheville to [Hot Springs, NC](http://www.hotspringsnc.org/). Hot Springs is one of the cities that the [Appalachian Trail](http://www.appalachiantrail.org/) goes right through the middle of. The sidewalk that is on the main street of Hot Springs has "AT" trail blazes embedded right into the cement. Our visit was more to the AT than to Hot Springs, so Mazie loaded up into the kid carrier and we headed out for the trail.

I knew we weren't going to get much of a hike in. I figured Mazie would make it an hour in the carrier and she did just about that. She did a great job walking by herself on the flats. She navigated the roots like a star and looked smashing in her bright green fury jacket.

It was fun to be on the AT and hiking with the white "blazes" of the AT in sight. Honestly the trail was no different than any other hiking trail we could have been on. However, this one could take you all the way to Maine if you just kept on walking. How cool is that?

We put up a set of picture from today. Enjoy!
