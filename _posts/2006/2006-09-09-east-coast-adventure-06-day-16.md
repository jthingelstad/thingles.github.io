Day 16 of the Great East Coast Adventure was a lot of fun. Mazie got us all up at the normal time and we decided to go into Princeton to have breakfast at [PJ's Pancake House](http://www.pancakes.com/). I'm stunned that they actually own pancakes.com. What an awesome URL. I can almost guarantee that some "with it" student at Princeton gave it to them. We had a stunning breakfast that could not be beat and started the day out right. If you find yourself in PJ's -- I highly recommend the Buckwheat Pancakes.

After that we met my boss and his wife and we all headed to the [New Jersey Grounds for Sculpture](http://www.groundsforsculpture.org/) (Sculpture Garden). This place was really impressive and a lot of fun. Perfect outdoor activity for Mazie as well. It's much bigger than I expected, and the sculpture is very well done. As a bonus, they have done an incredible job of getting the landscape that surrounds the sculpture just right. A+ and a great time with kids.

Tammy, Mazie and I headed to dinner at the [Main Street Bistro](http://www.mainstreetprinceton.com/) after that and had some really good food. I've wanted to take Tammy to the places that I typically go to when I'm here on business. That way when I call home and say "I went here" she actually knows where I went. I've probably been to this restuarant more than any other in Princeton.

We had a relaxed evening and at 10:00pm I drove to Newark airport to pickup Grandma Kaye and Aunt Angie who are staying with us for the next couple of days.
