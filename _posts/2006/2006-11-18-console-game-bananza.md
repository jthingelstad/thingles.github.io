My friend Chad brought over his brand new Playstation 3 today and I got my first taste of the hardcore gamer dream machine. The graphics are stunning, particularly when paired with a nice high-end HDTV. The games were obviously first generation and I'm sure they will get progressively better over the coming months. However, not my kind of gaming system. Very focused on first-person shooter type games.

On the Wii front, Tammy decided that I had become enough of a "fanboy" over the Wii lately that she ordered me one. I'm hoping it will be here before Thanksgiving for some family fun waving the Wii controller around in the air.
