Yesterday we were at Best Buy on my occassional visit to wonder around the store and just check stuff out. Tammy finds these trips annoying since I rarely buy anything, and after 5 minutes decide to leave. Yesterday though I decided to check out the gaming aisles and stumbled on the [Nintendo DS](http://www.nintendo.com/overviewds). I had read about these ["brain games" for the DS in Scientific American Mind magazine](http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=00016C9D-2761-1477-9D3383414B7F0000&sc=I100478) and was intrigued. They had one of these on the demo unit so we played it, and it was pretty fun. 10 minutes later we walked out of the store with a DS Lite and three games.

I decided that my ban on ever buying a gaming console again (at least until Mazie is old enough to find it fun) was not applicable since this is a portable unit. So far, it's a lot of fun and the portability makes a great for flights. The initial set of games we got were [Brain Age](http://www.brainage.com/launch/index.jsp), [Big Brain Academy](http://www.bigbrainacademy.com/) and [Super Mario Bros](http://mario.nintendo.com/). Now it's time to start looking up information on hacking the DS! :-)
