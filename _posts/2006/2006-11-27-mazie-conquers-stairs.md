Lately most of the news on the Mazie front has been about new words. Lot's of new words. She can usually get her point across now, at least to Mom and Dad, and she's picking up new words faster and faster.
However, a couple of days ago she made it down both flights of stairs in our house without any help. Obviously Mom and Dad are surrounding her with hands ready to grab her if she falls. She's really careful, and braces herself to the wall but makes it pretty solidly down each stair -- one step at a time.

She's a long ways from navigating steps without help, but she sure does have fun walking down them. She gives a triumphant giggle when she finishes all the steps.
