Right around [4 months ago Tammy and I spent the evening at our neighbors house](/thingelstad/mazies-birthday) with a really cool local artist named [Erik Sletten](http://www.slettenstudios.com/). Our neighbors have several of his works and we were celebrating with them the arrival of two new ones. That night I got to do something I had never done before -- flip through an artists sketchbook. I was flipping through [Sletten's](http://www.slettenstudios.com/) sketches and as I turned the page in the middle a sketch caught my attention in a unique way. A couple of weeks passed and we decided to commission the work.
This last weekend we got to do another first. We joined [Erik](http://www.slettenstudios.com/) in his studio as he started to introduce color to our piece. It was a fun evening, and a unique opportunity to connect with him and the art. Tammy and I had mixed feelings about joining him while painting. As I told him, I want the painting he would paint, not the painting I would suggest him to paint. But Erik is a cool guy, and very chatty to boot, so it was a lot of fun.

Here is our painting being birthed in raw lines. I can't wait to see it finished. For scale, the canvas is 5.5 feet square.
