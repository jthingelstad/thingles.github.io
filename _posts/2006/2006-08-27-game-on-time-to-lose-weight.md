Over the last couple of years I've really let my weight slide. Or should I say, climb. Slide would imply sliding down something, and I've definitely not been going down, but instead going up. I won't even recount reasons for this -- whatever -- it is what it is. It's time to reverse the trend and restore sensibility!

I've been logging my food now for two weeks. I dropped a little over 3 pounds last week. I'm happy to be logging my food. It provides a structure for me that I find very helpful. I'm going to be away from home for the next 5 weeks and I will be using my food log to keep things in control. I'm shooting for around 2,000 calories a day, plus or minus.

My first goal is to get back below 300, that will happen pretty soon. After that 280. And then to 250. When I got married I was at my lowest point I can ever recall, 210. That's not a goal, mainly just focusing on 250.

I actually don't have an option other than lose weight. Next summer my father-in-law has arranged a trip with all the son-in-laws. We are going to Canada fishing for a week. It sounds like a lot of fun, but the final leg of the trip is on a seaplane and each person is limited to 330 lbs of load, including themselves. So, I either drop a decent chunk of weight, or I have to go with no food, gear or clothes. :-)

I'm going to post updates on the blog here. I know from when I did this the first time (and this had better be the last time!) that it's good to share your objectives and progress with others.
