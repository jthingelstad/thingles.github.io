I recently caught up to this new episode of [Nova](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/) called the [Monster of the Milky Way](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/blackhole/). I like Nova, but this is one of the better ones I've seen and if you have the opportunity to [watch it](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/blackhole/program.html) in full high-definition wonder the computer graphics are stunning. It's also just incredibly interesting stuff.
