In the last couple of weeks we've had a lot of progress with our solar project. The work on the roof and in the attic is essentially done now. This leaves the compicated plumbing work in the utility room the remaining items. This Wednesday the contractor is supposed to be out with the whole team to turn the system up.

In the last weeks we've pulled out the existing two gas water heaters and inserted a new Takagi TK-2 tankless hot water heater. Right now that is providing all of the hot water since the solar system isn't up and running yet. I've been happy with it (it is the square unit on the wall in the picture).

I'll post a detailed write-up once the system is up and running. Many of you have asked me about the project and I've certainly learned a lot having it done. One big lesson learned is added alternative energy and high-efficiency energy to an existing house is not trivial!
