title: New Site Up!

After wasting a lot of time messing with the routing options on my Zywall 10 I think I finally got the port-forwarding configuration setup right so that the new website is up and running! Yeah! Hint for anyone trying to configure that on the Zywall, go to the manual, and jump to the example configurations at the end. It was the only way I found the _voodoo_ required to make it work.

Let me know what you think of the new site. There are a ton of features on it, and I'm planning on enabling some more stuff and filling out the corners over the next few days.

Regular visitors will notice that the photo galleries are gone. I'm looking for a solution for that that will work well with WordPress.
