We've ended our three weeks in the New Jersey/New York area. I find myself pretty eager to get away. We are going on vacation. It's the next step to going back home. But mostly, there are just _too many people_ around here! I've never really thought of myself as a "country mouse". I enjoy the city. However, after three weeks of dealing with lines at every checkout line and jammed traffic all over I'm happy to get away from it.
