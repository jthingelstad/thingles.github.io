I've started to get deluged with spam again at home. The last time this happened I decided to switch my email address -- a little "shake and bake" as it were with due credit to [Talladega Nights](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0415306/). At work I've been using [Postini](http://www.postini.com/) for years now and I'm a huge fan. They do an amazing job of handling spam and viruses -- both of which I had nothing to stop at home.

I would have loved to use Postini but they don't offer individual accounts, boo! However, they do have resellers. Some quick searches and I found a Postini reseller that set me up for $2.50/month per address. They got me setup very quickly and now I'm a much happier email recipient.
