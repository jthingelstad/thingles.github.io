[![](/assets/posts/{{ page.date | date: "%Y" }}/o_delonghi.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000220JZC/?tag=thingelstad-20)The title of this post is a reference to what one of my friends calls my regular coffee order. Iced Triple Espresso. It doesn't get me hot in the summer, in fact it's refreshing. It has enough caffeine in it to shock a horse. In fact, since the espresso is cold you can take a drink and hold it in your mouth, swishing it around. This will give you a caffeine buzz extra fast as it absorbs through the tongue (for best results, hold underneath your tongue as well). Not that espresso is all about caffeine. It does taste good after all. And I recently decided that I wanted to be able to have the espresso experience at home. So I ordered a [DeLonghi Magnifica](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000220JZC/?tag=thingelstad-20) fully-automatic espresso machine.

Fully-automatic is essentially like having a coffee shop in your home. This thing requires nothing of you other than hitting a couple of buttons. Occassionally you need to dump the grinds out, add some more beans and top off the water reservoir. But typical usage just involves turning it on, and a couple minutes later hitting the single shot button.

So far I'm really happy with it. Everything works exactly as advertised. I relied heavily on the user reviews on [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/) and this machine got nothing but good comments. We'll see how it stands the test of time.

In the meantime, I'm enjoying effortless cups of espresso with perfect crema every time.
