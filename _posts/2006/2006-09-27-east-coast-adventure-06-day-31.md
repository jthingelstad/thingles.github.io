Let me get caught up first. On Friday we left Asheville and headed to Charlotte to spend the weekend with Tammy's biological father Ed and his wife Nancy. We had a very nice time with great company, amazing food and wonderful accommodations. We got to meet Ed & Nancy's son, and Tammy's half-brother, Christopher. Christoper is a little over 3 and is all boy. What a great kid! We also spent the weekend with Tammy's aunts, Betty Lou and Sandi, as well as Sandi's husband Bob. (Whew, got the whole role call there.)
It was very nice to get some home cooked meals after being on the road so long (31 days!) and to spend some time just relaxing. I think the highlight for me was just sitting on the deck in the back on Friday night chatting and looking at the stars.

On Sunday we headed out and continued the great adventure to Charleston, SC. We arrived in Charleston right around 5:00 pm and got checked into the [Belvidere Club Resort](http://www.belvidereclub.com/). This place is pretty great. We have an entire two bedroom "cottage" to ourselves. It's very comfortable.
