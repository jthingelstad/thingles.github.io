Releasing the Wii shortly before Thanksgiving was a brilliant move by Nintendo. I'm sure thousands of Wii's accompanied their proud owners on Thanksgiving trips to relatives houses where they were quickly added to the wishlists of others.

I brought mine to the Olson family thanksgiving morning and 3 hours of game play quickly swept by. Kudos to Nintendo for making a game that people in their early 20s enjoy, as well as those in their early 60s. The Wii was a huge hit with everyone taking turns playing Wii Sports.

**Prediction: **The Wii is going to dominate the console market in units sold by a factor of 2 on it's nearest rival.
