[![](/assets/posts/{{ page.date | date: "%Y" }}/o_mcfm.jpg)](http://www.millcityfarmersmarket.org/)Yesterday morning we went to the **[Mill City Farmers Market](http://www.millcityfarmersmarket.org/)**. It was our first visit, and only the second weekend that the market has been in operation. This market is different than the huge Minneapolis farmers market. It was coordinated by a number of people and led by the founder of [Cafe Brenda](http://www.cafebrenda.com/). The market combines great locally grown food, with orgranic practices. There are also people there with artisan cheeses and locally raised, grass-fed meat.
The space is great and there is even a musician playing resulting in an airy atmosphere that is relaxing and very enjoyable. I highly recommend it to anyone -- either to stop by for some bread and cheese for lunch or pickup some food for the week ahead.

Kudos to everyone who made this market a reality.
