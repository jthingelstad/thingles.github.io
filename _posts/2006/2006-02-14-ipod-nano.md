![B0007Y79B2.01._SCMZZZZZZZ_](/assets/posts/2006/b0007y79b201_scmzzzzzzz_.jpg)Happy Valentines day! My wonderful, beautiful wife and daughter decided to get me an iPod Nano for Valentine's day. How fun! When the Nano was first released I convinced myself that I didn't really care. Then a little after it was shipping I went to Best Buy and touched one. I shouldn't have done that. The form factor is just so small, and the screen is nice (if small) and it just feels so nice in your hand.

I updated the firmware on it, got it setup in iTunes and I'm downloading a ton of photos to it right now (the other reason I wanted a to upgrade from my iPod Mini). I like it so far, of course what is not to like.

I was considering the idea of getting the "big" iPod at somepoint. No need to now, however I may reconsider if the rumors of this big screen, wide iPod turn out to be true.
