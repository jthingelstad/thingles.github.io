[![](/assets/posts/2006/o_wordplay.jpg)](http://www.wordplaythemovie.com/)Last night Mazie's aunt came over and babysat while Tammy and I went out for a "classic" date -- dinner and a movie. We went to [Wordplay](http://www.wordplaythemovie.com/) at the Edina Theater. It was a fun movie all about the world of crossword puzzles. Sound like a topic that doesn't really deserve a movie? Well, that just means you aren't aware of the annual crossword puzzle tournament and the ridiculous speed at which some people solve a crossword puzzle (just over 2 minutes!).

The movie was great, and particularly fun for me since I have so many geeky hobbies: rc helicopter? rc cars? telescopes? home network? solar power? Watching [Wordplay](http://www.wordplaythemovie.com/) is like getting a 90 minute pass into this world of crossword puzzles. To an extent, you could envision a movie about one of your geeky hobbies with you in the hotel convention center talking to the guy about how amazing your telescope, helicopter, car is.

Fun, lighthearted movie.
