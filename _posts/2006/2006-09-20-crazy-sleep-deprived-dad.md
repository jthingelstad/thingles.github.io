Ever since we've arrived in Asheville, Mazie has had a horrible time sleeping. She's just screamed all the time in her crib and for the first time ever she has been waking up in the middle of the night and we've had to bring her to bed with us where she proceeds to kick us and wake up constantly making everyone unhappy.

The sleep issues have driven her father to the brink. I left the grocery store tonight with two 50 foot rolls of tinfoil. You bet, tinfoil! I'm determined to get this kid to sleep better. The room she was trying to sleep in was too bright. _So there I was at 7:00pm tonight slapping tinfoil on all the windows to black out the room._ I have to admit that I felt a little crazy while doing it.

So far it's worked. She went down on her own (first time in Asheville!) and is still asleep. I only hope that she makes it the whole night. Oh please, oh please...

_Update: While the blacking out of the windows did get Mazie to go to sleep on her own, it didn't solve the problem of sleeping through the night. She woke up at 3:30am and would not get back in her crib. After 30 minutes of attempting to calm her I brought her back to bed with us._
