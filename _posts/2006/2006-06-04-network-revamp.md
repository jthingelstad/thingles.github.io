My home network has been pathetic for the last few months. While doing our solar project and other work in the utility room I had to make some quick cable moves. The unfortunate downside of this was that for over 3 months my gigabit network has been nada, since I've got a 100 mbit link in between it and everything that matters.

I decided I've had enough of this and decided to redo the network -- right this time. I'm not done, but this weekend I got most of the physical work hung.

I put a 2' rack on the right and have all the network switches where I want them. I still have to move the ethernet runs in the house from the other side of the utility room to this side and put them in the patch panel. This will be a pain as it involves rewiring. And once that is all done, I'm going to setup a proper secure home network with [color zones for protection](http://theory.kaos.to/blog/archives/2005/07/15/armor-your-palace-securing-your-home-and-network). I expect this project will be a month or more before I finish it completely. I'll tell more when I do, and put a picture up of the pretty wiring.
