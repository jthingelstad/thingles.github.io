I've referenced our solar project on this site a couple of times, and this last week marked the most visible part of the project. The collectors were put up on the roof on Thursday.

The collectors are mounted on the north side of the roof, but peeking over so they have a full southern exposure. There is still a lot of work to be done inside the house. The integration with the hot water and heating system are coming up next.

I've got some mixed feelings on how the collectors turned out and am going to discuss some alternatives with the contractor. It's not exactly how I had expected it to look. Hard to imagine without seeing it. Not positive anything will change but am going to explore it. I'm not terribly pleased with the view from the deck.

See all the pictures of the collectors.
