title: Save Some Birds

Over this past weekend I applied some bird protection to our house. We live in an area with a lot of birds, and we have large parts of our house where we have a lot of windows. On top of that, I like to feed birds and with the landscaping work that we've done over the last three years we've seen a marked increase in the number of songbirds that frequent our yard.

However, we've also seen a huge increase in "bird strikes". Almost everyday birds would hit our windows, and sometimes the hit would be fatal. I searched for a while to find a solution to this problem and finally found [Window Alert](http://www.windowalert.com/).

I've applied these decals to the major windows where we were having problems and so far it's been great. No hits that we've heard since then. They don't ruin the view -- and while you can see them they are not annoying. They work by reflecting ultraviolet light which birds can see, but we cannot. If you have a problem with "bird strikes" you should give these a try.
