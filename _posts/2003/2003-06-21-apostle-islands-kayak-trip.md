Tammy and I took a weekend kayak trip with [Trek & Trail](http://www.trek-trail.com/) out of [Bayfield, WI](http://www.bayfield.org/) recently. The trip was their [Paddle Through Time](http://www.trek-trail.com/apostle/overnights/PTT.html) trip going through the [Apostle Islands](https://www.nps.gov/apis/index.htm). It was a wonderful trip.

* Day 1 (3.2 miles) - Paddle to Sand Island and setup Camp
* Day 2 (13.1 miles) - Paddle from Camp 1 to Camp 2, 2 lighthouses and a hike
* Day 3 (9.5 miles) - Paddle from Camp 2 to Bayfield
