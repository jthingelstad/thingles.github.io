When we were on our honeymoon in Denver, Tammy saw this piece of art in a gallery and instantly fell in love with it. The artist did a series of hanging sculptures around car doors from old VW bugs. She then had a variety of dogs in the windows. One in particularly had a blue dog that she really loved. It is in some way a knod to [George Rodrigue](http://www.georgerodrigue.com/)'s work, however actually affordable for mere mortals like us.

When she saw this piece she knew instantly what she wanted done. Here is Tammy's friend Liane painting the mural.

Here is the sketch that the mural was painted from. This sketch was scanned, blown-up and then projected onto the wall to provide a guide.

We absolutely love this. We live with all of our art, but this is part of every day.
