Tammy and I went to our first movie since Mazie was born today. We saw _[Walk the Line](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0358273/)_ if you are interested (and yes, it was very good). We also went to a new restaurant for lunch before the movie. We tried out [Naar Grille](http://www.naargrille.com/). They opened up about 2 weeks ago. If location really matters I worry for them. They are not in an ideal location, there is no major road with people zipping by. The food however was very good. We went on Sunday which we did not know was buffet only, but it was quiet tasty.

The food is billed as Mediterranean fare. The gyros were very good, and everything looked tasty. I'd encourage people to give it a try - particularly if you like this cuisine.
