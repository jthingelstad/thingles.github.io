![](/assets/posts/2005/o_GeorgeWinsStage.jpeg)Everyone, really, anybody knows [Lance](http://www.lancearmstrong.com/) [Armstrong](http://www.lancearmstrong.com/) and the [Tour de France](http://www.letour.com/indexus.html).Not everyone knows one of [Lance](http://www.lancearmstrong.com/)'s close friends and longtime teammate
George Hincapie who took his first [Tour de France](http://www.letour.com/indexus.html) stage win today on the "Queen's
Stage" (thus named for being the hardest day of the tour).

George got in an early breakaway with a number of riders and he hung on
the whole day. With only he and Oscar Pereiro left in the final 2km he
was able to take the win.

[Lance](http://www.lancearmstrong.com/) winning the tour at this point is almost a guarantee. George
taking the stage was a complete surprise and a huge win for him. I
cheer for Hincapie all spring as he tries to win the big spring
classics, and I still hope that he will win Paris-Roubaix before he
decides to hang up his wheels. But hat's off to him on an amazing win
today.
