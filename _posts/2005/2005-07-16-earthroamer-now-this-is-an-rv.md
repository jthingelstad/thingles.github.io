[![](/assets/posts/{{ page.date | date: "%Y" }}/o_earthroamer.jpg)](http://www.earthroamer.com/)Tammy and I have occassionally thought about getting an RV. We like to
take long road trips and like to get off the beaten path. Particularly
with Tammy's fear of flying, we tend to drive long distances when it
comes to vacations.

The average RV though isn't really our speed. Then while Tammy was
flipping through a magazine she saw the EarthRoamer. This thing is
amazing!

Essentially, take a Ford F-450 turbo diesel and turn it into an amazing
off-road vehicle with plush surroundings. It's small, but [makes the
most out of it's space](http://www.earthroamer.com/galleries/xv-ltinteriorphotos/index.htm). Ecologically sound as well! The [EarthRoamer](http://www.earthroamer.com/)
uses solar panels and the truck engine to provide power -- no generator
on this thing. [It also runs on BioDiesel](http://www.earthroamer.com/main_truck/vehicle_2meangreen.html). You can take the EarthRoamer out into, literally, any
conditions for well over a week at a time and have no worries. Optional
items like satellite TV and sound system bring further comforts.

I sent them an email to see if they've ever built Internet access into
one. This would be the perfect vehicle to go to Moab or Alaska in. Who
knows, maybe in a few years, earthroamer.thingelstad.com will be up and
running! (You know I would have to do it!)
