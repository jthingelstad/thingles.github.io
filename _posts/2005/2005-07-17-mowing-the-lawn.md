![](/assets/posts/{{ page.date | date: "%Y" }}/o_CCR-Chronicles1.jpg)This is a rather pointless post but I wanted to share that I think Ihave found the best music for mowing the lawn, ever. Every weekend I
have to plod outside and fire up the lawn mower. My iPod is a dear,
dear friend during this one hour trek in endless circles around the
lawn. I used to listen to a variet of things, but now I've come to the
conclusion that there is no finer album to mow the lawn with than [Chronicles I](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:kq6ktr59kl6x) by [Credence Clearwater Revival](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:bxcm962o3ep3%7ET00).

Next time you find yourself sweating behind the lawn mower, give this CD a go, and you'll be markedly happier.
