I'm taking this week off, using up some of my remaining vacation time before it vanishes. Tammy and I are not feeling adventurous enough to go on a big trip with Mazie, so we are staying home for the week. I've picked a couple of projects to work on (like I need more of them!) and spending time relaxing and hanging out with Tammy and Mazie. We have some babysitting arranged so we can head out and have some outside fun as well.

I'm feeling really pumped about what I'm working on at the office lately (read: change the world), and it's hard to disconnect. But, I know it's healthy and I will come back after a week with even more focus and clearer vision.
