I was reading some "evergreen" content on [BabyCenter.com](http://www.babycenter.com/) tonight. They have some semi-decent [content targeted at dad-types](http://www.babycenter.com/dads/). Anyway, they highlighted hiking as an activity to do with your baby. I like hiking so took a gander.
They mentioned this group started in San Francisco called [Grateful Dads](http://www.gratefuldads.com/missionstatement.html).
It's a group of dads that get together once a month on a weekend
morning and go for a hike. It's all dad's and the kids vary from very
young, 2-3 months to about 2 years old or even older. I checked out the
site and I like the idea.

I know there are a decent number of dad's that read my site. Anyone
interested in doing some daddy/baby hiking? Mazie is a little young
right now, but in a couple of months would be plenty old enough.
