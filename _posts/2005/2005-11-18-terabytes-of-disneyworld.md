A couple of years ago when Tammy and I visited Disneyworld I was struck by the pervasive use of digital cameras and digital video equipment. I started to wonder, as I watched everyone around me merrily clicking away megabytes of storage, how much data is all this?
This train of thought simply would not leave my head, and I ended up doing some analysis on my own digital photography behavior, and ultimately trying to answer the question: How much storage does Disneyworld use everyday?

For this and a wonderful analysis of the storage issues with digital photography, read my article **[Digital Photograpy Storage Explosion]{% link _posts/2005/2005-11-18-digital-photography-storage-explosion.md %}**.
