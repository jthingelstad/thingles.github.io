![](/nGallery/photos/46/1660/320x213.aspx)This Tuesday Mazie will be 8 weeks old. It's time for us to schedule her 2 month appointment. I remember thinking how insane that was. We went from the 2 week appointment and then 6 whole weeks without seeing professional help. How would we do it!? Well, it's been fine. Mazie is doing great and so are we.

She's put on a good amount of weight. She's already well over 12 pounds. This last week in particularly seems to have been a watershed week. She's been so much more engaging and interactive than ever before. She will smile and play with you for a while. She loves it when you tickle her and play with her while she's on her changing table. Also, much to the pleasure of Tammy and I she's actually started to smile at us, instead of randomly at walls and other objects in the house.

She's been doing well with sleep, although sometimes she puts up a bit of a fuss trying to get to sleep. But once in the bed and snoring away, she does well. She seems to be spitting up a lot more lately than she did at first. I'm guessing that has to do in part with a lot more volume of milk going her way. It's pretty funny how being a parent pretty much makes all your "eww, gross" reactions go away. A pile of spitup goes all over your shirt, you wipe off the visible stuff and continue on your way, no worries.

She's a strong girl too. I've been holding her up and letting her support her weight with her legs. She can do this for a few seconds at a time and then needs a break. She likes to lean up against me in a standing position for minutes at a time.

That's all for now. Of course I put up some more photos as well. You'll notice two pictures of me sleeping with Mazie. This seems to be a not to uncommon occurrence.
