Applied a couple of upgrades to the blog this morning. Decent amount of work that will have absolutely zero impact on you the reader. :-)
I did a decent amount of research on upgrading from my .Text blogging engine to it's successor, Community Server. CS is now at 1.1 and it's improving, but it's got a lot of pork with forums added. While it is certainly feasible for me to migrate, great people out there have written [wonderful tools to help make that possible](http://kevinharder.com/blogs/kevin/archive/2005/06/09/dottext_cs_converter_22.aspx), I'm going to wait a bit longer I think. Perhaps wait for a 2.0 release. In the meantime I'm stuck using my great, but now dead, open-source .Text package. So, time to spiff it up a bit.

First, I removed all the old spam protection I put on my sites with the random character CAPTCHA and all that and went a different route using this [ReverseDOS toolkit](http://www.angrypets.com/tools/rdos/) from [angrypets.com](http://www.angrypets.com/). I just installed it this morning so we'll see how it goes, but it doesn't put the burden on a person and tries to make life real hard for spammers.

The second big upgrade was to move from FreeTextBox 1.0 (built into .Text) to [FreeTextBox](http://www.freetextbox.com/) 3.0. The main driver behind this was so I could have a nice, rich editing environment with spell checking in Firefox (FTB 1.0 did not support Firefox). This proved to be a bit of a hassle, lots of trial and error, but I now have it working great. Google is the savior here of course since there are about a dozen sites that tell you how to do it but they all seem to be missing one or two steps. You have to feel your way with Jedi-like focus in order to get it working. These are the best references: [DanBartels.CS](http://blog.danbartels.com/articles/266.aspx), [Dave Burke](http://dbvt.com/blog/archive/2005/02/15/1264.aspx) (2.0 actually, but steps are helpful) and [Markyologist](http://markyologist.com/2004/07/11/FireFoxFreeTextBox2AndText.aspx) (don't forget the browsercaps!).
