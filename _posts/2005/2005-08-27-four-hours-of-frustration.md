I just spent the last four hours trying to get my new network topology in place. The result of all that time is zilch. I installed [pfSense](http://www.pfsense.com/) 0.79.4 on the firewall box with four ethernet ports. I tried to setup a WAN, LAN, DMZ and WIRELESS networks but I couldn't get anything working right. How frustrating. I'll take another run at it some other time.
