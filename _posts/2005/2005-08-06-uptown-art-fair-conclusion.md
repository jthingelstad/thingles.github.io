Tammy and I returned to the [Uptown Art Fair](http://www.uptownminneapolis.com/art-fair/) after having [previewed yesterday]{% link _posts/2005/2005-08-05-uptown-art-fair-preview.md %}. We brought Mazie with us this time, so we went early to avoid the heat. It was another great day and the crowd was immense even at 10am.

We took a walk through the area we like the most and saw some more artists that we really liked. Tammy also found a [custom purse by Laura Maclay](http://www.pursesnatcher.com/) that she really liked and decided to get.

Further artist highlights (again in no order):



  * We found [John Sumner](http://www.johnsumner.com/) at the art fair. We totally missed him the first day and we have a giclee of his, [Moe](http://www.johnsumner.com/AboutMoe.htm), that we got in [his gallery](http://www.johnsumner.com/gallery.htm) in Sonoma, CA.


  * We were struck again this year by the [photography of Edward Holland](http://www.edwardhollandphotography.com/). We came really close in previous years to getting one of his items. He's got an amazing eye and produces these striking, vivid photos.


  * I was struck by the work of [Liang Wei](http://www.wlart.com/) from Washington. He had a number of pieces that I really liked. Tammy wasn't quite as taken with him as I. Hope to see more from him.


  * We really like the work of [Jay Long](http://www.jaylong.com/) as well. The art is striking. Unfortunately for us it was all framed in oak, and we really, really don't like oak.

As I predicted yesterday we returned to Keith Grace to make our annual purchase. We got the dog painting that you see in this post. It's a great piece and we really liked his technique. He combines collage, acrylics and oils to make these striking, graphic pieces. The collage work also ties back to the subject of the painting as well.
