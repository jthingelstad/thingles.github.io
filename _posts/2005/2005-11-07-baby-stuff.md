A couple of weeks ago Tammy, Maze and I all loaded into the minivan and headed on down to Iowa City. Our friends Dan and Melanie had just had their first baby, [Henrik](http://danandmel.home.mchsi.com/archives/2005/10/entry_48.html). And as a kicker our other friends Lisa and Eric had just bought a house and are expecting their first. It seems everyone is doing this baby thing!

It was great to [see Dan and Mel and little Henrik](http://danandmel.home.mchsi.com/archives/2005/10/entry_60.html). It was a little like stepping in a not-so-way-back machine because I had almost no real recollection of Maze being that small! I held him for a while and he felt light as a feather as he slept away happily in my arms. Wonderful little baby really.

The other thing that was funny was I realized how quickly I had become an "old hat" at this whole Dad thing. In a short 4 months it seems I've gotten pretty comfortable with it all. It was fun to see Dan in the same space I was in when Maze was born.

Dan got a blog running right before Henrik showed up and has been [commenting on the experiences](http://danandmel.home.mchsi.com/). It's a fun read. (Unfortunately, you can't comment on it, which makes me sad.)
