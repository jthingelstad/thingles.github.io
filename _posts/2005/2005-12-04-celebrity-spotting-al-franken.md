Okay, so maybe this is the Minnesota version of a celebrity spotting. It's not [Madonna](http://www.madonna.com/), or [Bono](http://www.bonoonline.com/), or any other single-named person (really, how pompous do you have to be to only have one name?).

Today when Tammy, Mazie and I were going into the [Galleria](http://www.galleriaedina.com/) for some shopping, we were passing in front of the entrance of [Barnes & Noble](http://www.bn.com/) and there is [Al Franken](http://www.alfrankenweb.com/) getting out of a black Lincoln towncar. Apparently he was in town for a book signing event so a lot of people had this "Celebrity Spotting".

Anyway, we didn't gawk or anything. Didn't want to make Al feel awkward. :-)
