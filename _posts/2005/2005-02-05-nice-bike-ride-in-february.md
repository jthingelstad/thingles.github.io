I took advantage of the unseasonably warm weather today to get out on my bike. I realize that you can indeed ride year-round even here in Minnesota, but it takes a fortitude that I do not seem to have. However, today's 50+ degree temperatures made it a great day to get out on the bike.

I did a quick 17 mile ride down to the lakes and back. I wasn't the only one with the idea, there were plenty of cyclists on the trails. I should have wore my leg warmers and booties. My bottom half was a bit frigid.

What a great day!
