I just finished [Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince](http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?ISBN=0439784549). I rifled my way through the sixth installment of the Harry Potter series much faster than the [Order of the Phoenix]({{site.url}}{% link _posts/2004/2004-09-28-harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix.md %}). I found the Half-Blood Prince to be one of my favorite in the series in a very odd way. The story was different than the last five books. Each of them seemed to have a very finite start and finish. The books would start, there would be some very interesting story, and then after a climactic conclusion everyone would head home for the summer. This one had a different feel. It seemed like it was distinctly setting up something big to go down in what everyone expects to be the final, seventh book, in the series.

I was pleased that Rowling didn't feel a need to make an even longer book than the previous ones. I'm still wondering if we wont get a Harry Potter volume that exceeds 1,000 pages at some point. The story was fun, exciting and I'm not going to ruin the plot and tell you anything about the last 300 or so pages, other than to let you know I found it hard to put it down at that point. I'm not one to rifle through hundreds of pages in a book at once, but I just had to know what was going to happen next.

Now I need to go search the Internet to see what people are guessing will be in the next and final, volume 7!
