A few months ago I bought the Roku [M1000](http://www.rokulabs.com/products/soundbridge/models.php#M1000_model) MP3 player for Mazie's room. I really liked it, even [wrote on here about how great it was]{% link _posts/2005/2005-06-06-roku-m1000.md %}. Well, I liked it so much I decided to buy two more. Not the M1000, but the cheaper [M500](http://www.rokulabs.com/products/soundbridge/models.php#M500_model). Roku was running a sale, I think moving them out to make room for new models. I picked up two to put the whole music collection in the bedroom and a yet-to-be-determined location.

Install was easy as can be. Hardest part was finding a power outlet for it. (Note to self, need to redo power in bedroom!) Still like these units, even though I'm ultimately left a little frustrated with UPnP servers.
