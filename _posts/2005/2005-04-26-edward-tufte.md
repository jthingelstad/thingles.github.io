Yesterday I attended _[Presenting Data and Informtion](http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/courses)_ taught by [Edward Tufte](http://www.edwardtufte.com/). A number of people that I work with had gone to this one-day session and come back raving, so I finally decided to attend this myself. After attending I can see why they were raving!

If you are unfamiliar, Edward Tufte is one of the leading world experts on visualization of data. I'm pleased to say that not only is Tufte an excellent academic, he's also a wonderful speaker. He could do a radio program in no time flat. He's got a great presenting style. I thought the class was going to give him a standing ovation at the end.

I'm not going to repeat the class contents here, I could not do it justice. Check out [the website](http://www.edwardtufte.com/) and see for yourself. If you ever have to give presentations, I would highly recommend attending this session.
