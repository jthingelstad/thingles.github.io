title: Make Minneapolis Bicycle Friendly

A few months ago I [sent a suggestion to the mayor of Minnetonka]{% link _posts/2005/2005-03-20-make-minnetonka-bicycle-friendly.md %} to request that they work with the League of American Bicyclists to get Minnetonka the designation of a Bicycle Friendly city. She had someone on her staff look into it but they ultimately decided it would be too difficult to pursue.
In the new flyer from the League I noticed that Chicago had just received this designation. So, I dropped a note to [Mayor Rybak](http://www.ci.minneapolis.mn.us/mayor/) of Minneapolis on this topic. Maybe Minneapolis would go for this. If you think this is a good idea, how about sending him a note yourself.

I am a member of the League of American Bicyclists as well as a member of the local Twin Cities Bicycling Club. Mayor Anderson's staff looked into the award but were unable to justify the investment.

If Minneapolis achieved the designation it would be the first city in Minnesota to do so, and hopefully not the last. I think this would be a fitting achievement for the state that leads the country in miles of "Rails to Trails" paths.
