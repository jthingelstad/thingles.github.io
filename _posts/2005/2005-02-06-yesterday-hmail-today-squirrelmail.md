Had [last morning with hMailServer](/thingelstad/switch-to-hmail). This morning it was [SquirrelMail](http://www.squirrelmail.org/)'s turn. Decided to use this contrary to my firmly held belief that [PHP](http://www.php.net/) and Windows just don't belong together. It actually installed really easily, I even got a fair number of plugins to go with it. [SquirrelMail](http://www.squirrelmail.org/) is a very nice webmail client, gotta admit.
