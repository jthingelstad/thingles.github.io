title: MacMice Not So Great

I have to withdraw my [endorsement of the MacMice]({{site.url}}{% link _posts/2004/2004-12-21-mac-mouse-done-right.md %}) 2-button wheel mouse for the Mac. There are two main issues with it. First, it takes it far too long to come out of sleep mode and to wake up the iMac. The Apple mouse does this instantly and the MacMice takes as little as 5 to as long as 20 seconds. Very annoying.

Worse is that occassionally it just operates very poorly. It's movements become choppy and unpredictable. Too bad, this one button mouse is a drag. I realize I could plug a Microsoft BlueTooth mouse in but it would just be wrong. In the meantime, I've got them both on the desk so I can wheel from time to time but use the Apple mouse most of the time.
