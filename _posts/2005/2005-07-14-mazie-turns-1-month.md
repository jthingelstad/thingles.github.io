Today is Mazie's 1-month birthday! It's an odd stretch of time. It seems in some ways like forever ago that we were in the hospital and [brought her home](/thingelstad/happy-birth-day-mazie-kaye). I look at her now and she's already grown so much. We have gotten over our regular panics and now just panic every once in a while. We no longer have to track feedings and diapers to make sure all the inputs and outputs are working right.

Other milestones are starting to occur. Tonight, for the first time, I got to watch her all by myself for about an hour while Tammy went grocery shopping. We are teaching her to start taking a bottle, and it's not a very easy process. We are also trying to get her to accept a pacifier, but that also isn't going so well. She seems to only want the "real deal".

We've made it out now a number of times but we still feel a lot more comfortable at home. We haven't taken her on many walks due to the extreme heat. So, we've been mostly sticking to the house waiting for 6 weeks to pass when she'll have more of an immune system.

I put up a collection of photos from the last three weeks as well.

She's a great kid, amazing, we love her like crazy... and we're pretty tired. :-)
