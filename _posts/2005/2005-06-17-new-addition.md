It is tradition that a husband get his wife a present after the delivery of a baby. After being in the room and seeing in every little bit of detail all that is involved, a present hardly seems a satisfactory way of saying thank you. We decided to celebrate this event with art rather than the classic gift of jewelry. Art lasts just as long as diamonds. I contacted [Amy Lynn Stevenson](http://www.amylynnpaints.com/) who we already have [one piece from](http://www.amylynnpaints.com/Paintings/118.html) and discussed what I wanted to do. She came up with a wonderful painting that she titled ["New Addition"](http://www.amylynnpaints.com/Paintings/254.html). The dimensions are 5 feet wide by 3 feet tall.

I really love it and Tammy was very happy with it. I can't wait to some day give it to Mazie to have in her house.
