Sometimes I just feel like typing something on this here website. I guess that's the advantage of being the site operator, author, editor, publisher and everything else.

This has been a busy week. I've been completely absorbed with this project at work. We finally got it launched today and I really think it's one of the, if not _the_, most amazing thing we've done. If you are curious, go to [MarketWatch](http://www.marketwatch.com/) when the market is open (M-F 9:30a to 4:00p ET) and look at news stories, quotes, etc. You'll see the quotes are streaming at you. We did this ourselves, and it was a massively challenging and fun project. I was literally unable to sleep, waking at 4:00a most days, my mind whirring with ideas. I've gotta take some time this weekend and decompress a bit. I put some especially peaceful music on my iPod so when I wake up in the middle of the night I can try to listen to that to help me sleep.

I sort of took today off, even though Mazie and I went into the office for a couple of hours and I was email for a couple more hours at home. We had furnace contractors, roofing contractors and our landscaper over today to discuss projects. I pulled the trigger on the furnace one so that is going forward. I need to decide on the roofing project soon so that I can let the solar guys (we are also looking at solar heat and electric) know what is going on.

We are starting phase 3 of our landscaping project. First phase was the front yard, 2nd was some hardscaping in the back yard, and this final phase is the conversion back to native plantings for the undeveloped area in our backlot. It was completely filled with invasive plants, and we are now getting ready to transform it. It will be perhaps the most challenging and interesting of the projects, but the least visible, at least from the curb as it were.

I'm debating the whole solar thing. I'm not sure what I think about having 4'x6' black panels sticking up off the top of the house for heat. The solar electric stuff is much less obtrusive, but has a lot higher cost.

We are heading to Wisconsin for a family weekend with Tammy's side of the family. I expect it to be a blast. May pack up the telescope since we'll be in darker skies. I feel a little bad that I haven't given that the time it deserves. I really do have too many hobbies. It's just that everything is so interesting! :-)
