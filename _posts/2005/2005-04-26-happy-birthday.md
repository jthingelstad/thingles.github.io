Today is my lovely wife's birthday! **Happy Birthday!**

I learned very quickly when Tammy and I started dating that her birthday is a Big DealTM. Don't get me wrong, I like my birthday and all. It's fun to get together with people, celebrate another year and maybe get some cool gifts. But for Tammy it's an entirely different level. I joke with her that it should be declared a national holiday.

How about a birthday haiku.

A birthday for you  
Another year for fun, love  
And then, a birth day.
