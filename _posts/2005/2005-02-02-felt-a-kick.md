Tammy has been feeling the baby kick for a couple of weeks now. She didn't know what it was at first, she described it as a "flutter" in her tummy. I've been eager to feel it myself but until tonight hadn't been successful.

I felt just the slightest movement. Tammy described it as a pretty strong kick so I don't think I have a chance of feeling the softer ones yet.

How exciting!
