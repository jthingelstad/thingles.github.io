A friend and I [got coffee](http://www.starbucks.com/) today and the total came to $4.58.

I gave the person at the register a $10 bill and three pennies.

Expecting that I would then get a $5 bill, a quarter and two dimes.

Instead of the quarter and two dimes she gave me nine nickels! This sets me back in a huge way with the **[change game](/thingelstad/change-game)**.

[And you thought doing [math on road signs](http://www.roadsignmath.com/) was geeky? Ha!]
