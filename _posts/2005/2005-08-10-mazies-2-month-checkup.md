Mazie had her 2-month checkup today with the pediatrician. I arranged my schedule so that I could go as well. We really liked the pediatrician that we met with. He was recommended by our neighbors who have two kids.

Mazie is doing great. She's a big girl! She's 97th percentile for both height and weight, and 75th percentile for head circumference. She's already 24" long and tipping the scales at 13 lbs 1 oz. (For reference, she was 7 lbs 11 oz and 21" long at birth.)

The hardest part of the visit were the shots. Mazie got 4 different shots, after we confirmed they were [single dose vaccines that contained no mercury](http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/_/id/7395411?pageid=rs.Politics&pageregion=single4). The nurse had me hold her hands and talk to her to comfort her. The shots were done in like 5 seconds, but Mazie let out one heck of a yelp when she got poked. I picked her up right away and held her tightly in my arms and she relaxed pretty quickly, and then even fell asleep. I felt really bad for her -- poor little girl.

She's been having a hard time tonight, residual effects from the vaccinations. After a good nights sleep I think she'll feel better.
