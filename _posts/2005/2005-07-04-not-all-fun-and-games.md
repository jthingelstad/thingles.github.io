Tomorrow Mazie celebrates becoming three weeks old. She is filled with anticipation of exciting "three-week-old" things like having some milk, making some dirty diapers, maybe even taking an extra nap in the afternoon.

In her first three weeks Mazie continues to be amazing and incredible and beautiful and simply the best, or at least according to yours truly, Dad. She's learned to exercise her lungs more with some mild wailing. I find that it bothers me less if I consider it exercise. She's gotta learn how to get all that air in and get it out quick after all! She is still being very nice to us and sleeping relatively well. I've acquired a very valuable skill -- being able to put her to sleep at night. I just talk about computers, telescopes, [Road Sign Math](http://www.roadsignmath.com/), etc. :-) In all seriousness, the nightly routine involves me swaddling her real tight, which she hates at first and cries and pushes against but after a few minutes of rocking she settles down. Then we put the "heartbeat" CD on fairly loud which makes a womb-like sound for an hour. Perhaps not surprisingly this puts all of us to sleep pretty quickly as well.

Tammy is obsessed with her being too hot or too cold, still. She's also obsessed with cleanliness. We changed her diaper for the first time today _outside_ the house, at Eden Prairie center. There was much care taken to make sure nothing was touched. Germs! Everybody had to wipe off with the baby wipes after leaving. I find it all very funny and cute, but it's really great too.
