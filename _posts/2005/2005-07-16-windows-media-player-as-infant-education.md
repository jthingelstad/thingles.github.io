[![](/assets/posts/2005/o_ColorCubes.jpg)](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/mp10/getmore/visualizations.aspx)I learned a new trick tonight while holding Mazie. We were sitting onthe couch and I had my laptop next to me. I was singing to her and
keeping her occupied and decided to put on some classical music. Mozart
of course. And then it dawned on me that I had a great infant toy in
front of me, so I gave it a shot.

I maximized the WMP visualization window and put it in random rotation
with Mozart. I then held Mazie on my lap so she could see the screen. I
had always figured these [visualizations](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/mp10/getmore/visualizations.aspx)
were only interesting to those on illegal substances, but it turns out
1-month old Mazie really dug it. She was watching the spinning graphics
and when the screen would suddenly change to something else she would
stop sucking my finger for a moment and check it all out. She
particularly liked the flutes in the Mozart selections we were
listening to.

Forget the [Leap Frog](http://www.leapfrog.com/) -- just grab your laptop!
