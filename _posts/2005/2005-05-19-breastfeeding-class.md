Tonight Tammy and I took the breastfeeding class at [North Memorial](http://www.northmemorial.com/). I have to admit to a bit of hesitation with this class. I asked more than a couple of times "husbands are supposed to go?". Don't get me wrong, I'm entirely into the whole baby experience but it wasn't obvious to me what role the man really plays in making breastfeeding work.

Now after having taken the class I actually think it was one of the more interesting baby classes to date. Quite a bit of information that I didn't know and I really left thinking how amazing the whole process is.

This weekend I'm taking the Baby Boot Camp class that is just for Dads. I'm actually pretty interested in that class. Hopefully they'll answer some of the dumb first-time dad questions.
