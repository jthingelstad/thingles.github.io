On Saturday Mazie went to her first concert, and it was rocking! Our neighbor suggested that we go to see [Ralph's World](http://www.ralphsworld.com/) with their family. Mazie had a great time!

When I first walked into the concert I was a bit surprised. It was loud! Not as loud as a show I would have went to at [1st Avenue](http://www.first-avenue.com/), but a far, far cry from a guy with a guitar. [Ralph's World](http://www.ralphsworld.com/) looked like a real band. Dudes in t-shirts and jeans, guitars, bass and drums. The three things that were a tip that this was a kids concert were the hundreds of kids having a blast, the song titles like "We Are Ants", oh and the predominance of minivans in the parking lot.

I really thought Mazie would be screaming mad due to the volume, but she was digging it. She had a great time but had to cut it short because she got tired out.

If you have kids (you know who you are, see the minivan comment above), you should definitely haul the kids to a [Ralph's World](http://www.ralphsworld.com/) concert. You will have some fun too!
