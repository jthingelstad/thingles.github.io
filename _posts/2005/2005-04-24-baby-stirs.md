We are now in the 35th week of the pregnancy. Of course I say we in the modern husband way that really just means Tammy is in the 35th week. I'm cheering along! We're entering into the time where the alien is stirring. You can see the baby reaching out, punching, kicking. There is no need to feel, you can just sit there and see it!

The clock is ticking down!
