This should hopefully be the last of these baby updates before I'm putting up a picture of the little tike! We had another check-up on Wednesday with the midwife and not much is going on. The baby is healthy and all, but seems to be liking it in the womb a whole bunch! The official due date was last Sunday so we are **+4 days** after the due date now.

We are going to see the midwife again on Monday along with an ultrasound to check on things. And if the baby hasn't decided to come out by Thursday we'll be induced then. We'd really like to avoid that, but at least there is an outside date now.
