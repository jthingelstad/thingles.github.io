On Friday I got an email through one of the cycling mailing lists that I'm on that [Lance](http://www.lancearmstrong.com/) [Armstrong](http://www.lancearmstrong.com/) was going to be on Oprah that afternoon. I'm not an avid Oprah follower (imagine that!) so I asked Tammy to TiVo it so I could watch it later. [Lance](http://www.lancearmstrong.com/) was on for the full hour along with Sheryl Crow. You do know that he and Sheryl have been an item ever since he split with his wife, right? Anyway, some thoughts...


  * **Enough with Sheryl Crow!** This is [Lance](http://www.lancearmstrong.com/) [Armstrong](http://www.lancearmstrong.com/). He's won more [Tour de France](http://www.letour.com/indexus.html) victories than any other man in history. Yet it seems that his record 6 wins are often overshadowed by the fact that he's dating some "rock star". (By the way, Sheryl Crow is a rock star? Guess I wasn't listening.)

  * I'm sitting here wearing my LIVE**STRONG** bracelet and it's amazing how many of these things have went out. They've sold 46 **million** of them now. Holy crap! When we went and saw the [Tour de France](http://www.letour.com/indexus.html) last summer these things were the ID tag for the American Tour fan. Now it seems everyone has them. Okay, that's cool, but for some reason I'm a little bitter about it.

  * **I wish [Lance](http://www.lancearmstrong.com/) would stop the tour**. Really. He wont state publicly anything. His Discovery contract requires him to race one more. Seriously, I would rather he take on the spring classics or even better go after [the hour record](http://ida1.physik.uni-siegen.de/menn/hourrec.htm). He's talked about all of the above, but has been non-commital about it all. Added bonus here would be [OLN](http://www.olntv.com/) actually having **more** coverage of events other than the Tour. Non-tour coverage on [OLN](http://www.olntv.com/) has dropped every year, even while the total number of hours of cycling has increased. It's all [Lance](http://www.lancearmstrong.com/) and the [Tour de France](http://www.letour.com/indexus.html). Let's hit the cobbles of Paris-Roubaix!

  * **The Bike.** Oh my. So on Oprah they had this story, tough story really, of this woman with cancer and she is fighting and she seemed amazing. [Lance](http://www.lancearmstrong.com/) is her hero, etc. So at the end [Lance](http://www.lancearmstrong.com/) gives her this bike. **Oh My!** Some stage-hand wheels out this P.O.S. $199 Target special Trek to give to her. Huh? This is [Lance](http://www.lancearmstrong.com/). Trek is his sponsor. They couldn't spring for a carbon-fiber, ahh, anything? Wow. Even [Lance](http://www.lancearmstrong.com/) looked a little stunned when he saw it. Kinda like he was thinking "send that thing BACK!".
