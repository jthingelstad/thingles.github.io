title: Purple HDMI TiVo

I thought I had dodged this bullet, but this morning when I turned on my HD DirecTV TiVo I got "purple haze". Although, this was different than I'd seen it before. Usually if I just hit the ratio button on the HR 10-250 it would correct after a couple of times, but this is pervasive. It seems that all true blacks are showing up as purple.

This setup has been working since I got it in January! But today it decides to give up the ghost. I called up DirecTV and after 33 minutes of support discussion, and having the support person tell me "the HDMI port just doesn't work on these, it's a known problem, you need to use component video instead" I got them to send me a replacement unit. We'll see if it solves my problem.

This is a [very common problem](http://www.tivocommunity.com/tivo-vb/showthread.php?p=2530575).
