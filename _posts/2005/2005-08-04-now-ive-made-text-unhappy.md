title: Now I've Made .Text Unhappy

I've modified and specialized this website so much it's rather ridiculous. I use .Text for the site, and it's open source which is fun since you can change things, which I've done extensively. Now however I seem to have introduced a bug that keeps me from editing any post that is already published, the page throws an exception.

Trying to dig through and find what's causing this is going to be, well, interesting. One more incentive to move to a new code base that is still being supported. Ugh!

**UPDATE: **Actually it seems I've only broken it so that any post I create in a browser other than Internet Explorer, like [Firefox](http://www.getfirefox.com/), cannot be opened for editing again. This sucks, as [Firefox](http://www.getfirefox.com/) is the "Peoples Browser", but I think I can live with it for a while.
