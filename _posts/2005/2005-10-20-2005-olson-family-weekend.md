Last weekend was the 2nd annual Olson Family weekend. This is a fairly new tradition on Tammy's side of the family where everyone does a mini-vacation together for a weekend once a year. Each year someone different plans it. Tammy is excited for the 3rd one next year already because she is planning it. :-) This year started off well by being _much_ warmer than our [trip last year up past Duluth]({{site.url}}{% link _posts/2004/2004-10-18-grand-superior-getaway.md %}).

Corinne did a great job picking this years trip to the Wisconsin Dells, or as those in the know call it, "The Dells". We stayed at the [Wilderness Resort](http://www.wildernessresort.com/) cabins, which were very nice. The Wilderness is a little crazy, it's a giant resort, waterpark, golf, spa location and I think it has some locals unhappy -- but they seem to be doing a very good job. Tammy and I went to [Sundara](http://www.sundaraspa.com/) a while ago and loved it, which is also a Wilderness property.

It was a nice weekend with days outside hiking, [geocaching](http://www.geocaching.com/seek/log.aspx?IID=7d6b83eb-9c3a-415e-b83e-ca714f508508&LID=10874266) and exploring the Dells, and nights goofing around and playing [Xbox](http://www.xbox.com/). I put up a number of pictures from the weekend. It was also Mazie's first trip to Wisconsin, and she had a nice time hanging out with all her aunts and uncles (grandma and granpda too!).
