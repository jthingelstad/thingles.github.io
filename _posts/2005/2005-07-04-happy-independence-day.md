We aren't doing much exciting for the fourth this year. I really like fireworks but with Mazie being just under three weeks old fireworks don't sound like a good idea. [Hint: Stillwater has the best fireworks around!] We had a _classic_ 4th of July barbecue in it's place. Barbecued bison burgers and baked beans. Yum!
Some Independence Day moments of Zen to share...
