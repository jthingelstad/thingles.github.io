I think both Tammy and I are stunned at the thought that little Mazie is only going to be 3 months old this week. The 14th is the big day! She is very excited, I can tell. We are stunned because it seems like _forever_ since she came into our lives. That should not be read as a good or bad thing, but that the period of time before she arrived seems very, very far away. It's easy to sit back and think of things that happened, say a year ago, and feel like you are reminiscing about a previous decade! Anyway, time goes on for all of us and I'm sure that these first 3-months [have seemed even longer for her]({{site.url}}{% link _posts/2005/2005-02-21-fractions-and-life.md %}).

Mazie continues to grow and amaze us both. Since the [last update]({{site.url}}{% link _posts/2005/2005-08-07-mazie-at-8-weeks.md %}) here, she's developed a lot. She tracks you as you speak, or walk around. She giggles a lot and at least has convinced me that she likes to play little games with me. Mostly this involves me tickling her belly or cuddling her up and rocking her around. Then she giggles, I feel amazed, and we repeat until she's had enough of it and gets ready to blow a gasket.

Speaking of blowing gaskets, she has started to do that. The last few nights she's discovered her full-bore cry. We have started to wonder if babies can just get colic at 3 months!? This is when she's supposed to be settling into more of a pattern and relaxing. We've started to put her to bed earlier, partly as a result of the crying. She's getting more sleep but it's not necessarily doing anything about the crying.

Mazie went to visit her great-grandparents last weekend and did great. She went through 10 hours in her car seat each way without too much fussing, and delighted us both by keeping a fairly stable nighttime sleep pattern, however she was way too excited to take any naps during the day which lead to some cranky behavior.
