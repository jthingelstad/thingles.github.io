![](/nGallery/photos/48/1695/140x93.aspx)Little Maze is getting less little by the day it seems. Along with getting bigger she's really developing a lot more of a personality. She's got her "I want mom" cry, her "I'm hungry cry", and her "I want mom" cry. Did I mention that one already? We went through a few days a while back where she decided her dad simply would not do. If I tried to hold her she just threw a fit. She's gotten a lot better at that too, throwing fits that is. She can get her legs and arms shaking, and just wail. If this gets beyond a certain point there is nothing you can do but give her to mom.

She's also having a lot more fun cooing and blabbing to herself in the middle of the night. She particularly likes it when her dad tickles her and blows on her belly. She giggles away for a good long time. This ends up being endlessly fun for her dad and fills his heart with big amounts of pride and happiness. If you can make your kid giggle you can do anything.

We have her four month appointment next week. That seems to have arrived quickly. I think Tammy may disagree with that assessment though. That means another round of shots, no fun. We are looking forward to getting an okay to start giving her some food. We acquired a high chair already continuing our pattern of getting baby stuff well ahead of the need for it.

Maze loves [her new mini-van]({{site.url}}{% link _posts/2005/2005-09-24-honda-odyssey.md %}). She thinks it's just great. She particularly likes the navigation system. :-)

Tammy and her sisters threw a surprise birthday party for their mom recently and she did a little photo shoot with Maze and the birthday stuff. Some great pictures, check them out. My friend [Dan and his wife Melanie](http://2s1g.com/) are about to have start this parenthood thing any day now! With these 4 months under my belt I get to give advice to someone like I actually have a clue what's going on. That's fun too.
