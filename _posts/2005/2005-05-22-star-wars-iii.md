Tammy and I went to [Star Wars Episode III](http://www.starwars.com/) today. We made a point to go to the [DLP](http://www.dlp.com/dlp_cinema/default.asp) theater at the [Eden Prairie AMC](http://www.movietickets.com/house_detail.asp?afid=krtwinc&house_id=8163). The theater did a really great job with the entirely digital movie.

I liked the movie more than I expected. I figured it would be good, but it exceeded my expectations. The Star Wars crowd did not let down either, the nerd ratio was definitely on the high-end. The story was great. Perhaps my only negative, and it's minor, was that I didn't care much for the idea behind the droid general, although his saber moves were pretty impressive.

So the second arc of the Star Wars saga is concluded. I'm left really hoping that [Lucas](http://www.lucasfilm.com/) takes a stab at the final third arc with episodes seven through nine. We'll see!

I'm looking forward to the [War of the Worlds](http://www.waroftheworlds.com/) and the [Chronicles of Narnia](http://www.narnia.com/) series to come to the theater.
