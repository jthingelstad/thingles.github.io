Tammy and I have been working with the name issue. The responsibility of giving another person the moniker that they will carry for their entire life is daunting. I got a pointer to [NameVoyager](http://www.babynamewizard.com/namevoyager/) from a friend. [Go to the site](http://www.babynamewizard.com/namevoyager/) and then launch the Java application. It's very well done, and shows cool information about the popularity of names over time.
