We just had our roof redone, and of course they had to rip the DirecTV satelite dish off the roof. Last night, for the first time in 6 years (at least), I had to actually sit down and watch a TV show _at the time it was on_ and _with commercials!_ It was stunning.

Technology is interesting. It starts as a nice plus, and faster than you can imagine turns into a must have. I wanted to catch this show and I realized I only knew (and this was vague) that it was on Monday night. I didn't know what channel, and wasn't sure what time. I had to go to TVGuide.com (I felt like I needed a shower afterwards) and look up when it was on.

Then, had to rush to the TV and watch it at the time the network wants me to. Man, this whole thing just blew.

Thankfully the dish gets put back up tomorrow morning, and TiVo will spark back to life and make our world a much happier place again. Whew!
