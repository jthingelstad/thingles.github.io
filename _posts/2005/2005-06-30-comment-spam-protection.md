Just implemented some further spam protection to keep the _evil doers_ at bay. I installed this [great add-on that requires entering a validation code before providing feedback](http://blogs.clearscreen.com/migs/archive/2005/04/05/1270.aspx). I realize it is a bit of a pain, and sometimes the validation code is hard even for people to read, but it keeps those evil spammers away.
