We are now past the 3rd stage of the tour and it's clear that Discovery (formerly US Postal) has what may be one of the best tour teams ever assembled. It's also clear that whatever [Lance](http://www.lancearmstrong.com/)'s motivations are for riding this tour, he's serious. The first stage saw him take one to three _minutes_ from his rivals. All that in a little over 12 miles! Stunning performance in an individual time trial.
The last two stages have had great sprint finishes. This is definitely gearing up to be a legendary tour. Can't wait for the high mountains.
