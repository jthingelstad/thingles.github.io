Today we go straight from the [PhatBox MP3 player in the car](/thingelstad/phatbox-installed) to the [Roku M1000](http://www.rokulabs.com/products/soundbridge/) for the baby's room. I decided a couple of weeks ago that we needed to get music in there, the idea is both for us, the parents, and [for the kid](http://www.classicaliscool.com/coolbabies.htm).

For the last year we've been in [music nirvana](/thingelstad/music-nirvana-achieved) with every bit of music we own stored digitally on our server. Obviously I didn't want to start dragging out CDs to listen to in the kids room so I went looking for a stand-alone, WiFi music player. There are a lot of options and I've even played with some in the past (like [this one that I thought was horrible](http://www.netgear.com/products/details/MP101.php)). I decided to go for a high-end unit and ordered the Roku M1000.

This unit is simply amazing. I unboxed it, turned it on and put in my WiFi WEP key and instantly it was on my network. After a few clicks I was listening to streaming music. If only every product worked this well. I clicked a few more buttons and had upgraded the firmware in about 30 seconds. Seriously, I'd rate this one of the best products I've ever purchased. I'm tempted to rip out my [Audiotron](http://www.turtlebeach.com/site/products/audiotron/producthome.asp) and replace it with one of these.

We can now put childrens music on infinite repeat in the babies room at the drop of a hat and every now and then we can play some music or podcasts for ourselves when feeding or rocking the baby.
