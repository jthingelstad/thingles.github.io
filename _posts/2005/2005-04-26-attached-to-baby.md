I got a great email today from someone that used to work at our company. I haven't seen her for years, since she worked with us. We have emailed back and forth, mostly about baby stuff since she has one and we are expecting one. Anyway, her email today was telling me about her new website/business.

Without further ado, check it out at [Attached to Baby](http://www.attachedtobaby.com/). It seems that in addition to running the business she's also a model in a number of the pictures. :-) Buy some stuff!

This is great. It's awesome to see people putting out their own shingle and taking a chance. I hope she's immensely successful. Now, I need to go figure out what carrier we are going to get.
