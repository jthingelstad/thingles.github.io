This past week I was in Radio Shack and saw they were running a great deal on the Linksys [WRT54G](http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?childpagename=US%2FLayout&packedargs=c%3DL_Product_C2%26cid%3D1127782957298&pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FVisitorWrapper) wireless router (double rebates!). I've had a D-Link 624 for a long time and its worked without any issues. However, I'd read at length about the WRT54G and it's open platform. [Linksys built the WRT54G on a Linux platform](http://www.wi-fiplanet.com/tutorials/article.php/3562391) and made the firmware available via open source. There is some debate wether that was intentional or not, but the [GPL](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html) forced them to make it available. The result was awesome 3rd party firmware like [Sveasoft](http://www.sveasoft.com/) and [DD-WRT](http://www.dd-wrt.com/).

So, I picked up one of these cheap units at Radio Shack and today I sat down to play with it.

Then everything went south...

About [20 days ago Linksys (now owned by Cisco) started selling the WRT54G v5](http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000223067461/#comments). All the previous versions of this ran Linux, but now they are using VxWorks. Unfortunately, this means no 3rd party firmware. This seems like such a bad idea, particularly since this router became the success it is because of 3rd party firmware. Luckily there is a new model, [WRT54GL](http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?childpagename=US%2FLayout&packedargs=c%3DL_Product_C2%26cid%3D1133202177241&pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FVisitorWrapper) that is the v4 box with Linux.

Buyer beware if you are looking to get one of these.
