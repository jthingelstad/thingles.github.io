![](/assets/posts/2005/o_mazie-and-daddy.jpg)Mazie turns 4 today, 4 days that is. It's been an incredible four days. I realize everyone all over the world goes through this process all the time. As a result, it should seem somewhat routine from a global perspective, but on an individual level everything seems profound and amazing and like you are the first person in the world to ever do any of this stuff.

Mazie overall is doing great. She needs to catch up on diapers. There are numbers she's supposed to be hitting and she's behind. How do you like that? Four days old and already behind quota. She sleeps really well, usually getting two 4 to 5 hour sessions in per day, along with some shorter naps. She's a great sucker!

Some thoughts on my new title of "dad":



  * The first thing that comes to mind is that the parts that are easy are easier than I expected they would be, and the parts that are harder are way harder. I know that doesn't make a lot of sense, but maybe if you've been there before you know what I mean.  Like changing diapers, is trivial, but calming your kid at 3 a.m. is really hard.

  * Those protective father instincts sure kick in. I'm always worrying about her and want to protect her at every turn. Imagine when she starts to walk! I'm going to need a sedative.

  * I've never been one to be real comfortable with newborns. They seem so fragile. All that disappears in about 2 seconds with your own kid. There just isn't much better than laying with her on your chest and patting her back.

  * The most amazing thing in the world is being able to bring comfort to your baby. When she's crying for whatever reason, and you pick her up and put her to your chest and she calms down and is happy, that's amazing. Of course the reciprical is also true, when you cannot provide her that sense of calm, that is pretty much the most horrible thing in the world.

  * How can a kid that does not have precise muscle control get her socks off so easily!?
