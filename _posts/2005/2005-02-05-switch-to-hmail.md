title: Switch to hMail

I've been a longtime user of [Xmail](http://www.xmailserver.org/) for my home email services. [Xmail](http://www.xmailserver.org/) has been stable, reliable, etc. But it lacks [IMAP](http://www.imap.org/) support and configuration is entirely driven on text files. I decided to take the plunge and change over to [hMail](http://www.hmailserver.com/) this morning. So far everything is working great. Configuration was a lot easier. I was able to get all my mail transferred into the IMAP store. If you are looking for an easy to setup windows mail server I would recommend it.
