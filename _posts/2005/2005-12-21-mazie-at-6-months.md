Mazie turned 6 months old on Dec. 14th, and she had her 6-month Doctor appointment on Monday. She's doing just great. She's just growing faster and faster. She's essentially 75th percentile for weight, height and head circumference. She's mastered sitting up now and loves to sit on the couch or on the floor with tons of toys all around her banging things and having a blast. She's also started real food now. She only had rice cereal, aside from milk of course, until she was over the 6-month mark. She's started oatmeal now and really likes it. We've tried carrots which she was a bit suspect of, and at this point she's decided that bananas are not for her. Whenever she gets a mouthful of bananas she gets a really funny look on her face.

I can tell she's super excited about Christmas, or perhaps I'm just more excited about Christmas because of her. She's going to love digging into all her toys. :-)
