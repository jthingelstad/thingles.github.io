Tammy and I went to the [Living Green Expo](http://www.livinggreen.org/) today. This is the 3rd year that we have went to it and the 4th year for the event. It was particularly great this year. In previous years it has been held in smaller buildings on the [Minnesota State Fairgrounds](http://www.mnstatefair.org/pages/nfe_main.html), but this year they moved it into the grandstand and expanded it substantially. Attendance was also stellar. All the exhibitors were commenting on how busy it was, many were out of materials due to overwhelming traffic. It's great to see such attendance for a great event like this.
