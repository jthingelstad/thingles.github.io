I just discovered [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/). [Del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/) is a social bookmark manager. What's that you say? Essentially a way for you to manage your bookmarks across any number of computers using a tagging metaphor like [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/). And, even better, you can see what other people like that you like, etc.

I've added the last ten [things I've tagged on del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/thingles) to the right hand navigation bar of my website for fun.
