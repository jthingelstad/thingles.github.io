[![](/assets/posts/2005/r_telescope.jpg)](http://www.meade.com/catalog/lx/8_10_lx200gps.html)Today was my birthday. We went out of town to celebrate and spent a couple of days at the [Spider Lake Lodge](http://spiderlakelodge.com/) outside of [Hayward, WI](http://www.hayward-wi.com/). It's a really cool lodge. The rooms are just average but the lodge itself really looks like a "northwoods lodge". We hoped to XC ski and snowshoe but the lack of any good snow left us playing [Boggle](http://www.iwaynet.net/~ggwiz/boggle/) and seeing the [Lemony Snicket](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0339291/) movie.

I got a bunch of fun stuff for my birthday but most notable was a telescope that Tammy gave me. When I was a kid I used to go to the college in [Minot](http://web.ci.minot.nd.us/) and look through the telescope in the obersavotory. I was definitely one of those very geeky "space" kids. I hadn't really looked at telescopes for years and then someone mentioned some of the new telescopes and how easy they are to use. I picked up a copy of [Sky & Telescope](http://skyandtelescope.com/) and was amazed at how advanced telescopes have gotten.

Tammy got me the [Meade LX200GPS 8" telescope](http://www.meade.com/catalog/lx/8_10_lx200gps.html). It's an amazing device just to open up and spin around. The controls are so precise and the lenses and mirrors are amazing. I haven't had the opportunity to use it for actual stargazing but hope to in the next week or two. I eventually would like to play with some astrophotography but that will require some more knowledge before diving in. Tammy also ordered the model with UHTC, which stands for [Ultra-High Transmission Coating](http://www.meade.com/catalog/uhtc/) and gives about a 20% increase in brightness.

Anyway, I've picked up every astronomy magazine I could find and a couple of books and am trying to figure this all out. I can't wait to check out Saturn this month while it is opposition to the Earth.

_Don't I have a pretty amazing wife!? Lucky me. :-)_
