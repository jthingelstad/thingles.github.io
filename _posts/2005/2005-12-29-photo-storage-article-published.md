I sent my [Digital Photography Storage Explosion]({{site.url}}{% link _posts/2005/2005-11-18-digital-photography-storage-explosion.md %}) article to our editorial team at [MarketWatch](http://www.marketwatch.com/) to see if they would be interested in an [article version](http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7BE9933FD7%2D3E91%2D41E8%2DB645%2D78066FD53832%7D&siteid=mktw&dist=) of it for our site. They said it looked interesting so I wrote up a much smaller version and it was published today. [I got a byline](http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7BE9933FD7%2D3E91%2D41E8%2DB645%2D78066FD53832%7D&siteid=mktw&dist=)! :-)

This version is much abbreviated and less "research paper" like. If you find it interesting, check out the [original, unabridge version]({{site.url}}{% link _posts/2005/2005-11-18-digital-photography-storage-explosion.md %}).
