A week ago today Mazie introduced herself to us. Since then Tammy and I have shifted from glee to fright many times, sometimes all within a matter of a few minutes. We've been worrying about everything. First there was the lack of dirty diapers. My read of the situation was that she was starving to death. Tammy frets constantly about her being warm enough. Then there was the incident with blood around the umbilical stump -- I won't even go there. But it seems that we are getting the hang of it. Yesterday was our first _crisis free_ day.

Mazie on the other hand seems to be doing just fine even with her neurotic parents. She sleeps amazingly well, at times sleeping six hours straight through the night. We hope that isn't just a phase. She's co-sleeping with us which makes it a lot easier for everyone and I think keeps her calmer at night. She's caught up on her dirty diaper quotas, making up for lost time. She's simply adorable. After she gets her milk she has a tendency to get the hiccups. We ventured outside today on our first walk with the stroller.

Everyone kept telling me that everything will change when you have kids. I knew it would, it's a huge thing after all. But I feel a need to reiterate it and reflect that yes, everthing did indeed change, for the better.

I also put up some new pictures from Mazie's first week.
