I'm horrible at remembering certain things. At the top of the list is remembering to change the filters in the heater. I have no idea when I did it last, none. Finally it hit me that I can easily have my computers help me out. In about 5 minutes I created a quick Scheduled Task that will send me a reminder every month! I'm using [blat.exe](http://www.blat.net/) to send the email via a command prompt.

I am sharing this immensely obvious solution since I think others may find this worthwhile as well.
