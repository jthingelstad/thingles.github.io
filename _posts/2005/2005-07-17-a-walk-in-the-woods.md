[![]({{ site.url }}{% link /assets/posts/2005/o_WalkInTheWoods.gif %})](http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0767902521)It feels like a crime to re-read a book, at least for me. My reading
list is as long as my arm (actually, about five times longer than my
arm). I've got stacks of books that I want to read and haven't cracked
the spine of yet. So, when I think of taking time from all those
neglected books to re-read a book I've already read, I feel bad. It's
like I'm neglecting all those other great texts. However, it couldn't
be helped in this case. I had to re-read [_A Walk in the Woods_](http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0767902521).

I read this book the first time a few years ago and just _loved_ it. [Bill Bryson](http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/results.asp?ath=Bill+Bryson)
is a stunningly good author and very, very funny. I highly recommend
all of his books, they are extremely enjoyable. Walk in the Woods is
exceptional though even for Bryson.

The subject of the book is the [Appalachian Trail](http://www.appalachiantrail.org/).

First, for those that don't kow about this trail, it is a 2,175 mile
hiking trail that extends from Georgia to Maine. Every year people
attempt to hike it's length, called "thru hikers", only a small
percentage of those that start make it all the way to Maine.

[_Walk in the Woods_](http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0767902521)
is Bryson's attempt to hike the trail. His is joined by a very
non-hiker friend of his, Katz, and you are treated with laugh-out-loud
humor as you trek through the woods with these two.

I would like to hike the AT at some point. It takes about five months
to hike completely, starting in early spring in Georgia and ending in
fall in Maine. Until then, I'll just have to join Bryson and Katz on
the trail every few years.
