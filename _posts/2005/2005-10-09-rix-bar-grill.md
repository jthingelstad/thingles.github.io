We tried a new restaurant today. It was my mothers birthday a couple of days ago and we went out for lunch. We chose [Rix Bar & Grill](http://www.rixbargrill.com/) in north Minneapolis. Rix is fairly new, replacing what I hear was a fairly rundown bar that used to be there.

The restaurant was non-assuming and relaxed. Open kitchen, nice bar area and a medium size dining room. We had a really nice experience and great food, I would recommend others to give it a try.



  * The sweet potato french fries are a must. I love sweet potatoes, and these were just stunning. The chipotle dipping sauce is great as well. I also give the green bean appetizer high marks.


  * I had the huevos rancheros, which is only available on Sunday. It was very good, with plenty of kick.


  * The deserts were tasty, however if you order the rhubarb tart make sure to get ice cream with it. It's a big mistake that they don't serve it by default that way.

_Update: We've been to Rix a couple of times since that initial visit and it continues to be a great, neighborhood stop. Give it a go!_
