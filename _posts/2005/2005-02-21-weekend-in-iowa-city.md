We just got back from a quick overnight trip to Iowa City to visit friends. We wanted to get out of town for a night on the long weekend (I have today off!). Let me start by saying that I'm not a fan of college towns. Maybe I'm bitter and old or something, but it just seems like there is a constant rolling beer party going on in these places and at this point I'd rather skip it. Our hotel stay drove this home very clearly as we were awaken at 4:30am to obnoxious people in the room above us. I just laid there thinking GO TO SLEEP ALREADY! Jhez...

On the plus side Iowa City is a nice town and has some amazing restuarants. We had dinner at One Twenty Six with Tammy's friend Lisa and her husband Eric. Tammy has known Lisa since living in Arkansas. I had a beef tenderloin at One Twenty Six that was as good, if not better, than any I've had at any steak house I've been to.

The next morning we had breakfast at [Lou Henri](http://www.gazetteonline.com/go_article/0,1336,18893-74,00.html)'s with my buddy Dan and his wife Mel. I can highly recommend the 7-grain pancakes there! Also, they do something so cool -- they give a 10% discount if your ride your bike there.

If you go to Iowa City, check these places out. And, whatever you do, don't stay at the Fairfield Inn. :-)
