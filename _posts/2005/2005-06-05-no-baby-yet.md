Well it seems public opinion polling on thingelstad.com wasn't very accurate for the baby delivery. 58% of people predicted the baby would be here by today; the official due date for the kid. If the trend continues I don't have a lot of hope that the 25% of you that predicted today or tomorrow are going to get it right either. It's very possible that those three people that went for the proverbial "long ball" may get this right. These are probably the same people that guess 1 cent over the highest person on the Price is Right.

Tammy can't wait to get the delivery on. The end of pregnancy doesn't seem to be very enjoyable in any manner. If you've been there, you know the drill. Lot's of bathroom trips and never being comfortable. She's eager to begin the trip back to being a "normal person", however this time also being a mom.

We are prepared for everything. I've been on a mad dash to finish a few final projects. It's very odd to plan everything one day at a time. Whenever I make a plan for next week I have to footnote it with "except if the baby comes that day". I'm sure it'll still hit me like a ton of bricks when it does happen.
