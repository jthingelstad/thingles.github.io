Ran across this product today and am tempted to order it just to have fun in sports bars! Some ingenious person made a keychain remote that broadcasts over 200 different shutoff codes for several hundred TV manufacturers. Annoying TV? [TV-B-Gone](http://www.tvbgone.com/product.php)! Only $14.99, well worth the value. :-)
