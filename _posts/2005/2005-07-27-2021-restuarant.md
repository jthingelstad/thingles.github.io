Tammy and I went out for our anniversary this evening to [20â€¢21](http://www.opentable.com/rest_profile.aspx?rid=4353), the new restuarant in the [Walker Art Center](http://www.walkerart.org/).The restuarant is an asian-fusion fare, which may seem a bit tired at
this point, but they do it well. The menu was put together by famed TV
chef [Wolfgang Puck](http://www.wolfgangpuck.com/). The
initial impression that Tammy and I both had was surprise at the size
of the place. We both expected something much larger. The dining room
itself is very cozy and modern in design. The next thing that hits you
is the pure number of staff. There were nearly as many people working
as there were eating, and the service reflects this. Our waitperson was
very well versed on our options and gave good advice. The wine menu was
not huge, but very complete.

The items are all served family style, for two people they suggested to
order 3 items. All of the items we ordered were prepared to perfection.
The main course, a marinated iron steak on a bed of rice, was packed
with flavor.

I took the opportunity to have the signature desert inspired by the [cherry sculpture](http://garden.walkerart.org/artwork.wac) in the [sculpture gardens](http://garden.walkerart.org/index.wac). It was stunning looking and if you like chocolate, this is the desert for you.

This is definitely a good restuarant to visit for a special evening.
