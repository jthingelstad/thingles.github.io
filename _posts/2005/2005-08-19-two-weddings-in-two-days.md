This is wedding weekend for us! Tammy's sister Michelle is getting married tonight and we are both in the wedding. Tammy is a bridesmaid and I'm an usher. Luckily my mother is coming to help with Mazie duty but it's going to be an interesting adventure timing breastfeeding and other parent duties with all the wedding stuff going on.

Then, tomorrow morning I get on a plane to New York for my friend Greg's wedding. Tammy and Mazie are staying here. The first Northwest flight out is at 10:20am arriving in La Guardia at 2:00pm. The wedding is at 4:00pm in Central Park. And just to make things exciting the Northwest mechanics are expected to go on strike at the end of the day today. Luckily Greg's wedding is going to be a relaxed affair so I could get there as late as 3:30pm, but it's tight!

Whew! Hope this all goes smoothly!
