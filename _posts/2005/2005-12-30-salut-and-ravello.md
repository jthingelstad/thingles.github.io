We stopped by two new restaurants yesterday and were happy with both. We had lunch at [Salut](http://www.salutbaramericain.com/) in Minneapolis, at the 50th and France area. [Salut](http://www.salutbaramericain.com/) is a fairly new French bistro. Don't let the French part scare you off -- they have an extremely approachable menu. It's owned by the same people that own [Manny's](http://www.mannyssteakhouse.com/) (my favorite steakhouse!), [Chino Lationa](http://www.chinolatino.com/), [Good Earth](http://www.goodearthmn.com/), etc. so you can rest assured that it's going to be at least passable.

We entered the restaurant and I was shocked by it's size. Much bigger inside than I expected from the outside. The menu was very good. Tammy and I had a glass of the Riesling. Wine at lunch? Sure, we're on vacation! It was great. I had the steak frites for my lunch and Tammy had the steak sandwich. My tenderloin was amazing, and the frites were equally impressive. Highly recommend this place.

We then had dinner with our friends [Jim and Suzie](http://www.jimbernard.net/) at [Ravello](http://www.ravello-restaurant.com/). We ended up here because of a recommendation from a friend at the office, and really liked it. It's in [Long Lake](http://www.ci.long-lake.mn.us/) so a bit of a drive unless you live in the western suburbs. They have a nice wine menu, and the lamb shank was delicious.
