Tammy and I went to see [Million Dollar Baby](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0405159/) at the late matinee today. You would have to live under a rock to not have heard some of the publicity surrounding this movie, but I really didn't know much about the plot. It's a great story about a woman that is extremely persistant and gives everything to realize her dream as a boxer.

The movie is a real tear jerker. There were no dry eyes at the end of it. Tammy said that pregnant women should beware. She said she was on the verge of bawling! Nonetheless, it's a great movie.
