We followed up [the death ride](dayone2://view?entryId=48C4E7E914044D5E8E9A34EAAF8F90D8) with the Rollercoaster. I have to admit, aside from the headwinds and the rather cold weather and a general lack of convenience stores, this ride is gorgeous. The ride goes through some really pretty canyons where you ride along streams up through Majestic Rock state park, and has some incredible views. While the ride has a respectable amount of climbing, it didn't feel like it was beating you on the head all day. All in all, great route. Believe it or not, there was even a flat stretch for a little while!

Here is the ride map.

Like I said above, this ride didn't seem to have that much climbing, but looking at the numbers it did. There were only a couple of real steep climbs. Maybe it's just that I've seen enough of them now that they don't scare me as much. 8-)

Nothing too exciting on speed on this route, but I did all 102 miles of it at an average speed of 15 mph, not bad considering how tired these legs are.

I'm debating tomorrow, I may ride the short loop, or I may take the day off. I'm happy with my milage and I would like to see a little bit of Fredericksburg before I leave. Also, I hear there is a good massage shop in town and a 2-hour rub down sounds like near heaven at this point. I'll decide in the morning.
