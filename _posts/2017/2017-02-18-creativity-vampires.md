I have observed in myself this dynamic of low-effort, low-value activities removing the *need* to do high-effort, high-value activities. The graph below illustrates what I mean.

The more I tweet, the less I blog.

Tweets are easy, simple and fast. They are also low-value, ephemeral and simple. When I tweet I satisfy this urge that I have to write and express myself. It reminds me of constantly taking the pressure out of a system.

The problem with this is that I never build up that urge to express a more complex thing. I find that if I limit these low-value frequent outlets, I eventually feel a *pressure* inside me to create, to express myself. Then I make something that is much more valuable (at least to me!) and expresses a complete thought as opposed to a digital belch. It's not even an option to me because I will get a *need* to do it. That *need* never happens if I'm constantly relieving the pressure.

There is something here related to the concepts in [Amusing Ourselves to Death][amusing], which was written before the social sharing digital world we are in now, but continues to be relevant.
