description: What apps do you have on your phone that are making you a better person?
---

I've been very intentional about which applications I put on my iPhone and even where I put them. I don't put any social media applications on my phone, and don't put news applications on it either. I specifically seek out applications that have addictive patterns baked into them and remove them as well.

A while back I started keeping an entire page of applications that are all there to help me achieve my goals and improve as a person. Novel idea huh? This is what that screen looks like today.

![Apps To Make You Better]({% link assets/posts/2017/apps-make-you-better.png %})

##### [YouAte](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/youate-food-diary-tracker/id1164976477?mt=8&uo=4&at=1001lxyE&ct=thingelstad_com)

Keeping a food journal is a great way to eat better and YouAte does it all with photos. I had used [Rise](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/rise-nutrition-weight-loss-coach/id794278760?mt=8&uo=4&at=1001lxyE&ct=thingelstad_com) for a while which you typically use with a coach. YouAte can be used with friends for support or you can use it solo.

##### [Day One](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/day-one-journal/id1044867788?mt=8&uo=4&at=1001lxyE&ct=thingelstad_com)

Journaling is a great way to reflect on things. This is by far my farvorite journaling application. It supports multiple journals and also has strong encryption.

##### [stickK](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/stickk/id776128765?mt=8&uo=4&at=1001lxyE&ct=thingelstad_com)

When my book club read [Nudge](https://rwbook.club/book/nudge/) it referenced the work and theory behind commitments that has now been built into an offering called stickK. I haven't used this for a commitment yet but I like the mechanics and think it's a solid approach.

##### [Happy Scale](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/happy-scale/id532430574?mt=8&uo=4&at=1001lxyE&ct=thingelstad_com)

This is a great application for logging and analysing your weight data. It applies smoothing to all of your data which I think is a far superior way to look at weight data.

##### [Headspace](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/headspace-meditation/id493145008?mt=8&uo=4&at=1001lxyE&ct=thingelstad_com)

Meditation app with a tremdendous amount of options.

##### [Streaks](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/streaks/id963034692?mt=8&uo=4&at=1001lxyE&ct=thingelstad_com)

Streaks is a habit tracker. I consider habit trackers to be very different from task management. Habit trackers tend to focus on streaks, and Streak does just that. I've also used [Productive](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/productive-habit-tracker/id983826477?mt=8&uo=4&at=1001lxyE&ct=thingelstad_com) in the past and like it a lot. The built-in HealthKit hooks in Streak are a nice benefit to me.

##### [Zones](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/zones-for-training/id1139688415?mt=8&uo=4&at=1001lxyE&ct=thingelstad_com)

Zones is a fabulous app for tracking the intensity of your workouts and letting you know what heart rate zone you were in for how long. If you have an Apple Watch and collect this data Zones can even tell you info on historical workouts.

##### [SleepTown](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sleeptown/id1210251567?mt=8&uo=4&at=1001lxyE&ct=thingelstad_com)

Fun app that helps you keep consistent sleep patterns. This app helps me make sure I'm not staring at my phone too late.

##### [Forest](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/forest-by-seekrtech/id866450515?mt=8&uo=4&at=1001lxyE&ct=thingelstad_com)

Fun app for forcing yourself to not use your phone during the day. Great for keeping yourself from habitually checking your device.

##### [Health Mate](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nokia-health-mate/id542701020?mt=8&uo=4&at=1001lxyE&ct=thingelstad_com) & [Omron Wellness](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/omron-wellness/id883492518?mt=8&uo=4&at=1001lxyE&ct=thingelstad_com)

Both of these are here because they support devices I have. The Health Mate app connects my Withings Scale to HealthKit so data flows automatically. The Omron Wellness app connects my blood pressure monitor to HealthKit as well. I like having as much automation as possible from measurements to storage.

### What is yours?

What apps are on your mobile device to encourage good things? I'd highly recommend putting them in one place and making it a regular stop on your phone.
