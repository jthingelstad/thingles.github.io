My mother sent me a link to [Turing Tumble][tt] on Kickstarter and the video totally got me. It is a super cool concept and a great way to explore the fundamental concepts of computing. The *bits* that can be flipped and other various objects are really neat.

I backed this and am looking forward (and hoping!) for the November delivery. This will be a great present for the kids (and me!) for Christmas.

The results of the Kickstarter are impressive. It has been live for less than 1 day and it's very close to hitting it's goal!
