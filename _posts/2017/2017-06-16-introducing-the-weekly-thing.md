description: The launch of my new weekly newsletter, the Weekly Thing!
---

A while back I tried a way of sharing links to things that I found interesting every week. I did it by making a link blog post and then sharing links to that blog post. I got more positive feedback on those posts than I expected. People really liked them and found value in what I was highlighting.

But I didn't like the link posts cluttering up my blog. They felt different and I eventually decided to stop doing the posts mostly because I was frustrated with how my website was coming along.

### Email Newsletters

I enjoy a number of weekly newsletters. I subscribe to [MacStories][] for the members only [Club MacStories][club] newsletter. [Patrick Rhone][pr]'s [One More Thing][omt] is a very well written personal newsletter and a treat whenever it comes. Sitting down with an espresso and my iPad to casually read through weekly newsletters is a treat on the weekend.

Email newsletters are *'old school'*. There is something about the medium that feels more personal and more conversational than others. I wanted to try this out, and realized that those old link posts were the right foundation to build upon.

Next I wanted to see how hard this would be. I quickly looked into [TinyLetter][tl] and realized it would be pretty easy. I like that TinyLetter exists as a way for personal email newsletters. It's very easy to use.

### Weekly Thing

With the basis of my links I decided to put together a newsletter. I went with the somewhat goofy name of the Weekly Thing playing off my last name. Total aside, but I used to own the domain `thing.org` in the mid 90's. I was at the U of MN at the time and I got an email from [The Thing][tt], a museum in Germany, asking if they could have the domain. I transferred it to them, seemed the right thing to do. My future as a domain squatter was determined at that time. 

I've been quietly publishing the Weekly Thing for a few weeks now to an invited group of friends. I've been testing out my automation and the structure. I'm very pleased with how it's working and this week put the [subscribe] page live and started sharing it. My first goal is to get to 100 subscribers and continue to flesh out the content. I hope you all enjoy it!
