On Friday night we were driving to the cabin, and in a split second, a deer ðŸ¦Œ was in front of our Honda Pilot as we hit it at 45 mph. We had driven down to have dinner at [Smoqehouse](http://www.smoqehouse.com) and were on highway 60 heading east, just a mile or so past I-35 right by the Dairy Queen there. Tammy was driving and just as the speed limit was going up to highway speed. Everyone is okay, and happily, the airbags didnâ€™t go off.

Tammy slammed on the brakes, and the deer flew forward. It rolled and slid into the ditch about 20 feet and immediately leapt up and ran off when it stopped. Its legs were okay, and Iâ€™m hopeful that it either miraculously survived or didnâ€™t suffer badly.

The car took a decent amount of damage but remained drivable. The radiator got banged up, and many parts of the front were damaged. All fixable but will be some expensive bodywork.
