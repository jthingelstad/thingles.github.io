Us at the top of one of the higher dunes at the midpoint of the [Saugatuck Dune Rides](http://www.saugatuckduneride.com) tour. The dune ride was a lot of fun, if your in the area put it on your list. Kids had a blast too. You can see Lake Michigan from the top of this dune, and the driver gave a great overview of how the dunes were formed. Interesting note, all the trees around us are actually **six individual trees** that have been covered in over 100 feet of sand!
