title: Password v. Passphrase

[Today's xkcd](http://xkcd.com/936/) highlights what might be one of the biggest security mistakes of our digital age: using passwords over passphrases. The comic does a great job of illustrating it. I've [mentioned before that I use 1Password]({{site.url}}{% link _posts/2010/2010-12-13-good-passwords-with-1password.md %}) to store over 400 unique, random passwords. But how do I unlock 1Password? A **passphrase** that is long. Very long.

Sadly being an active 1Password user I can highlight that many websites fail if you use passwords that are greater than 20 characters, much less a 40 or 50 character passphrase.
