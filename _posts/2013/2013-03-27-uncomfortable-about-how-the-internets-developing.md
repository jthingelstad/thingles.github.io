[Sue Gardner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sue_Gardner) [announced that she is moving on as Executive Director](http://blog.wikimedia.org/2013/03/27/sue-gardner-departure-announcement/) of the Wikimedia Foundation today. She highlighted where she wants to direct her energy next:

> Increasingly, I’m finding myself uncomfortable about how the internet’s developing, who’s influencing its development, and who is not. Last year we at Wikimedia raised an alarm about SOPA/PIPA, and now CISPA is back. Wikipedia has experienced censorship at the hands of industry groups and governments, and we are –increasingly, I think– seeing important decisions made by unaccountable, non-transparent corporate players, a shift from the open web to mobile walled gardens, and a shift from the production-based internet to one that’s consumption-based. There are many organizations and individuals advocating for the public interest online — what’s good for ordinary people — but other interests are more numerous and powerful than they are. I want that to change. And that’s what I want to do next.

So much about that mirrors concerns I have as well. My book club read [The Master Switch](http://rwbookclub.com/wiki/The_Master_Switch:_The_Rise_and_Fall_of_Information_Empires) two years ago. After reading that book I realized how real it was that the open Internet we've come to embrace won't just continue magically. It will need people like [Tim Wu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Wu), and soon Sue Gardner, fighting to keep it that way.
