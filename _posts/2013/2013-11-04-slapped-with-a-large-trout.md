A funny thing happened on Twitter yesterday. My wiki project that keeps a database of nutrition facts Tweets every 6 hours with a random food from itâ€™s 28,000+ entries. Yesterday, it highlighted trout:

Which promptly received an IRC-style trout slap!

So great. Two [bots](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_bot) being surprisingly funny. Trout slapping is a meme that started the 1990's in IRC. It warms my heart to see it alive and thriving on the modern web. :-) See also, [trout slapping on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Whacking_with_a_wet_trout).
