Photographer and friend [Layne Kennedy](http://www.laynekennedy.com) just put together this great book combining a ton of images he's taken in Iceland over the years, many of them were on the trip that I took with Layne, Steve LeVahn and [Dennys Bisogno](http://www.dennysbisogno.com). His photos are amazing! This book is a great walk through that wonderful place.

I got special thanks on page 83 for the green laser I brought over with me. You can see my [Iceland photos on my photography site](http://photog.thingelstad.com/tag/iceland/).
