Photographer and friend [Layne Kennedy](http://www.laynekennedy.com) just put together this great book combining a ton of images he's taken in Iceland over the years, many of them were on the trip that I took with Layne, Steve LeVahn and [Dennys Bisogno](http://www.dennysbisogno.com). His photos are amazing! This book is a great walk through that wonderful place.
