Tonight while on LinkedIn I was prompted for some people I might now, including this one.

So, yeah, in fact I do know my 8-year-old daughter. I didn't realize she was on LinkedIn? I wonder what professional updates she might have to share with me? **What?!**

I know for a fact this isn't a real LinkedIn account. Anyone know where LinkedIn gets this? And what are they doing here? My best guess is that the LinkedIn iOS application sucked this email address and name from my contacts and is now prodding me to click the "Add to network" button to allow them to start sending emails inviting this address to join LinkedIn?
