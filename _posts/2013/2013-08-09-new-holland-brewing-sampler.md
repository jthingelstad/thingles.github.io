While in Saugatuck we went to Holland a couple of times, it's just 10 miles or so up the road. We had dinner at [New Holland Brewing](http://newhollandbrew.com) and I got to do another beer flight. I skipped the [Dragon's Milk](http://new-holland.squarespace.com/beer/mainstays/dragons-milk-bourbon-barrel-stout/) since I've had it and can get it easily enough at home.

The numbers start at the bottom (6 o'clock is 1) and go clockwise:



  1. [Monkey King Saison Farmhouse Ale](http://new-holland.squarespace.com/beer/mainstays/monkey-king-saison-farmhouse-ale/)


  2. [Imperial Hatter IPA](http://new-holland.squarespace.com/beer/mainstays/imperial-hatter-imperial-india-pale-ale/)


  3. [White Hatter Belgian-Style White Pale Ale](http://new-holland.squarespace.com/beer/seasonals/white-mad-hatter-belgian-style-white-pale-ale/)


  4. [Mad Hatter IPA](http://new-holland.squarespace.com/beer/mainstays/mad-hatter-india-pale-ale/)


  5. [Beerhive Tripel](http://new-holland.squarespace.com/beer/high-gravity-series/beerhive-honey-ginger-tripel-ale/)


  6. [Paleooza Michigan Pale Ale](http://new-holland.squarespace.com/beer/agribrew/paleooza/)

I would happily have a full pint of any of them, they were all very good.
