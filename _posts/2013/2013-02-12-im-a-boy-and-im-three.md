When Tyler came down from his room this morning I gave him a big hug and wished him a very, very happy birthday. He replied to me that "I'm a boy and I'm three." Indeed Tyler, indeed. Tyler had a great day today. He had preschool and got to bring cupcakes for the other kids. He loves preschool. I ducked out of work early and we all met for a dinner of his choosing at Yum!. Tyler picked a big bowl of mac-n-cheese as always, and an even bigger cookie to celebrate his birthday.

We finished the day with presents at home and the whole family watching Misty Island Rescue, his favorite Thomas movie.

I asked him before bed if he had a great birthday he he said "Yes Dad." How great to be three!
