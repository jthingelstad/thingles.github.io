I make it a routine task to request removal from any and all catalogs that show up in our mailbox. Sometimes there is a bit of detective work to get removed from them, they don't go out of their way to make it obvious. This made me wonder why [email is required to have an unsubscribe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN-SPAM_Act_of_2003#Unsubscribe_compliance) method clearly displayed while catalogs and regular mail don't have any requirement.

There should be a requirement for unsubscribe information to be presented plainly and near the mailing label. In fact, how about a URL printed for each mailing address that unsubscribes that address? Heck, [I might even use a QR code for that](http://picturesofpeoplescanningqrcodes.tumblr.com)!
