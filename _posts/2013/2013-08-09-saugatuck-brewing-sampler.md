More opportunities to try local beers at Saugatuck Brewing. I picked a bunch of hoppy brews. The serving method was a little odd, if you had a table with 4 of these it would be a bit unwieldy. Overall great beer but one stood well above for me.

  1. Pathfinder Pale Ale
_Light, refreshing. Good hops. Straightforward, solid beer._


  2. Motueka's Revenge
_Good full body. Reminded me of Surly Furious, but less power on the hops. Like a 50% strength Furious._


  3. Fortunate Events IPA
_Bitter. Lots of bite. Not overly fruity._


  4. Not Messing Around Double IPA
_Holy cow! Oak! Bourbon! Very strong. Like drinking Jack Daniels. Not my thing, but I'm sure folks that like this would like it a lot._


  5. Singapore IPA
_Bitter. Not much body._


  6. Continuum IPA
_Delicious and packed with hops. Definitely my favorite of the group._

_Unfortunately their website is completely down right now, and seems like it has been for a while, so no links for these beers.__
