Having your own website is pretty fun. You get to be your own editor and can decide what things you feel are important and want to share with people. Sometimes things happen that really don't seem that big. For example, you may get [rain gutters installed on your house]({{site.url}}{% link _posts/2004/2004-06-07-rain-gutters-installed.md %}). Why would you ever put that up on a web site? [Who else would ever care about that](http://thingelstad.com/s/rain-gutters-installed/img)? Probably nobody.

You may think that getting a new vacuum cleaner would be the pinnacle example of such trivial nonsense that has no place being shared with others around the world. It's just a vacuum cleaner! Who cares!? Really. Get over it.

Well, I'm telling you, this is not just a vacuum cleaner. This is a miracle machine. It sucks dirt and cat hair with an efficiency that brings a tear to your eye. It leaves a visibly cleaner and more enticing carpet in it's trail. It is the [Dyson DC07 Animal](http://www.dyson.com/range/feature_frame.asp?model=DC07-ANIMAL).

First off, how cool is it that the vacuum is called _Animal_. Really, they've figured out how to get a man to actually care about what the vacuum is. Animal! Grrr! The thing is big, tough looking and purple. A manly purple, none of this lilac business. It could be in the shop, but it's meant for your house.

The real sweetness is tasted when you fire this thing up after reading the instructions. You really have to read them, it's a bit complicated. This is a turbine vacuum. No bags for this baby. And it's got this super cool clear turbine thingamajig where all the dirt and most notably cat hair spins around like it's in a little tornado. We ran this thing three times in a row in one room and took a half-gallon milk jug stuffed full of cat hair off the floor. There was more there, but we stopped for now.

When you take the dirt tornado thingamajig off it's like this Ghost Busters contraption that you take over to your trash can, pull a trigger, and the bottom flips off and the junk falls out. Yeah baby!

If you have a pets, you need an [Animal](http://www.dyson.com/range/feature_frame.asp?model=DC07-ANIMAL). This thing will suck the eyeballs out of a frog through the patio door. Amazing. I'll be sleeping on the carpet tonight.. it's that good. :-)
