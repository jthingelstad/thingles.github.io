Most people that know me know that I used to weigh quite a lot. Then I weighed a lot less. Now I weigh a little bit more, but by no means quite a lot. I went through a bit of a learning experience later in life. I've often thought that if I were a good enough writer (something I've been enjoying doing on my blog by the way) I would write a book about the experience.

I just finished reading a book that I think would be very similar to the book I would write. [Heft on Wheels](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1400052408/?tag=thingelstad-20) by [Mike Magnuson](http://www.lummox.org/) recounts his transference of his obsession with drinking and smoking to riding his bicycle. Magnuson's book is a fun, quick read and I felt a kinship to him in reading it. We shared many experiences, while still clearly being very different people. For example, he finished at the head of the pack in the Cat V race he tried while I was shot off the back very early on!

I should think it would be interesting to meet him some day. Perhaps on a ride.
