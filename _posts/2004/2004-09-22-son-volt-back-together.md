NO ONE EVER SAID IT WAS OVER: SON VOLT REFORMS AND RETURNS TO STUDIO

How awesome is this! This is the official release from [JayFarrar.net](http://www.jayfarrar.net/)

> **SON VOLT IN THE STUDIO**  
Midwest-based **Son Volt**, with songwriter **Jay Farrar** at the helm, will begin recording their fourth full length album at the end of September. Following a five-year hiatus, with the exception of the April 2004 recording of "Sometimes" for the Alejandro Escovedo tribute album, multi-instrumentalist **Dave Boquist**, bassist **Jim Boquist** and drummer **Mike Heidorn** will reconvene at Farrar's St. Louis studio. Speaking about the "Sometimes" session, Farrar says: "It felt like we hit the ground running when we recorded Al's song for _**Por Vida**_. Five years seemed like five days at that point. It proved that more recording and performing as Son Volt is something that should happen."
> 
> As this revered band reconnects, a unique glimpse inside the Son Volt sessions will be offered. Beginning October 1, a webcamera will be placed in the studio to capture a day of pre-production and 16 days of recording. The webcamera can be accessed at [www.jayfarrar.net/webcam](http://www.jayfarrar.net/webcam) and will feature streaming photos that refresh every 5 seconds. 
> 
> Farrar formed **Son Volt** in 1994 after the dissolution of **Uncle Tupelo**. With the release of **Trace**, **Straightaways** and **Wide Swing Tremolo**, the band was met with praise by the public and critics alike. From the plain-spoken chorus of "Windfall" to the gritty guitars of "Straightface", Son Volt has always pushed the boundaries to blend traditional American music forms with poetic imagery and straight-ahead rock.
> 
> **Son Volt** is not currently affiliated with a label and plans to return to the road in early 2005.

I can't think of a more exciting or unexpected piece of music related news I could have gotten today. Can't wait for the album!
