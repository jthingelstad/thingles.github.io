[![](/assets/posts/2004/r_davinci.gif)](http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0385504209)The last time I read a book as aggressively as I read [The Da Vinci Code](http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0385504209) had to be the [Dune](http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0441172717) series. I don't intend to elevate this book to that level, after all, [Dune](http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0441172717) is one of my favorite stories ever. However, this book is an absolute page turner. Usually books take about 50 to 100 pages to get me really interested. This one took the first 2!

I thoroughly enjoyed this book. A very fun read. I'm not going to say anything about the story -- I want you to be as surprised as I was while reading it.
