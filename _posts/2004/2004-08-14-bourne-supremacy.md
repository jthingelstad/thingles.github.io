Tammy and I went to [The Bourne Supremacy](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0372183/) last night. Fun movie with a lot of action and suspense. Lacked the excitement of [The Bourne Identity](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0258463/) in part because Identity was all new and we knew what to expect in Supremacy to an extent. Still very fun to watch. I did note that it seemed like most of the movie was filmed handheld or something. If you get motion sick easily (like me), watch out.
