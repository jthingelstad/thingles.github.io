I think it was three years ago that I caught the Harry Potter bug. In a matter of a couple of months I had read the four books that were available and loved every page. Yes, it's a kids book. But the story is just great.

I was very excited when the fifth book, the Order of the Phoenix, came out. I had pre-ordered it at least a year in advance on Amazon.com and it seemed like forever to wait. When I got the nearly 900 page tome I started reading it right away.

But then something happened. For the first time ever I wasn't all that excited to read it and it sat on my nightstand for months. I finally picked it back up and got infected with the Potter frenzy again.

The book was a great read. Very enjoyable (even with a 6 month pause in the middle). Clearly the story is evolving to even bigger and bigger levels. Now the wait begins for _[Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince](http://www.hpana.com/newsbrowser.cfm?tid=108)_!
