[![]({{ site.url }}{% link /assets/posts/2004/o_metabolic.gif %})](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0345441028/?tag={{ site.affiliate.amazon }})My friend [Phil](http://www.philiphotchkiss.com/) recommended [The Metablic Plan by Stephen Cherniske](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0345441028/?tag={{ site.affiliate.amazon }}) to me recently and I just finished reading it. After reading the first 50 pages I had to give him some grief for recommending this "overzealous" book on anti-aging however I recommend you do as I did and continue reading on. This book has some very good insight into the process of aging, what happens in your body and how you can fight off the negative (catabolic) effects of aging not with the intent of living forever but instead with the intent of enjoying your later years to the maximum of benefit.

I found the explanation of the aging process to be interesting and enlightening. I hadn't taken into account the aspects of aging thinking not about me as an individual but the human race as a species and how we are programmed. This book would probably be lost on people in their 20s (you'll live forever after all, right?) but for those in there 30s and with an eye on maximizing possibilities it is a good read. It's also a good read for those in their 40s, 50s or 60s as much of the information can improve your quality of life at any time.

The author is a strong proponent of supplementing [DHEA](http://www.supplementwatch.com/supatoz/supplement.asp?supplementId=102). I always get worried when someone is so vocally supportive of a supplement, however, he properly warns about dosage and when and for what purpose it should be used. Unfortunately, there will always be some fool that takes 300mg instead of the 25mg recommended and has some bad reactions.

Some links to information from the book (mostly for my benefit to refer to later!):
