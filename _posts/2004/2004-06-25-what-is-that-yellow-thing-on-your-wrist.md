If you are curious it is a Live Strong wristband. This is part of the [Wear Yellow](http://www.nike.com/wearyellow/index_f.html) fundraising campaign from the [Lance Armstrong Foundation](http://www.laf.org/) to raise money for cancer research. As many of you know I'm a fan of professional cycling, and as almost any US fan of american cycling I'm also a fan of [Lance Armstrong](http://www.lancearmstrong.com/).
