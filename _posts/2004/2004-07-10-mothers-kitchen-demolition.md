Tammy and I went and helped my mom today with the demolition of her kitchen. She's been working on her new house for the last year and this is the start of probably the biggest project, but also the one with the most impact, a new kitchen. We went over to help her gut the room to the studs and got plenty dirty in the process. Check out the pictures.
