I've been trying to order this [Dell 2005FPW monitor](http://accessories.us.dell.com/sna/productdetail.aspx?c=us&l=en&s=dhs&cs=19&sku=320-4111&category_id=4009) for a bit now and there is this [amazingly stupid] Dellf game that Dell has where you can win coupons. One of the coupons is a 25% discount on the monitor I've wanted so I've been banging on it over and over. I've won $50 off a $100 printer more times than I can count but never got the one I wanted.

Then [eBay](http://www.ebay.com/) came to the rescue. I'm continually amazed at what people sell on [eBay](http://www.ebay.com/). Turns out there are a plethora of [Dell coupon codes for sale on [eBay](http://www.ebay.com/)](http://search.ebay.com/dell-coupon). I punched it up and $2 later I had purchased a coupon code from some guy in California. Placed my order a couple minutes later. $2 to save $200+. Sounds good to me!

Monitor is on the way...
