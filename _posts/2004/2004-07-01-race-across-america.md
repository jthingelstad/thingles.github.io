The hardest sporting event in the world is finishing up right now. [RAAM](http://www.raceacrossamerica.org/) (the Race Across America) has concluded for another year and there was a bit more excitement this year with teams getting close on the road and even some espionage between teams. It's amazing what happens as you pedal yourself across the country without sleep.

This [animated progress map](http://www.caida.org/~dmoore/raam2004/) for [RAAM](http://www.raceacrossamerica.org/) is a nice way to see the race progress.
