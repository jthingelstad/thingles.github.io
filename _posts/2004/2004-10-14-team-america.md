This Tuesday we got the opportunity (Thanks Chad!) to go and see a sneak preview of [Team America](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0372588/). This is the newest movie from the creators of South Park. The schtick for this is that the entire thing is filmed using puppets. I have to admit that I found the fight seens with puppets banging against each other and strings clearly visible was pretty funny.

Don't go to this expecting any cerebral entertainment. If you went to anything from the creators of South Park expecting something other than just mindless chuckles you are sadly confused. It's a funny movie, and the political overtones are humorous. However, I may wait and catch this one on video rather than shell out hard earned dollars for it.
