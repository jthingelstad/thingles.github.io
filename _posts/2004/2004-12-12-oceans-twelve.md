Tammy and I along with her two sisters and their significant others went to see [Oceans Twelve](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0349903/) today. I thought [Oceans Eleven](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0240772/) was great so I was eagerly looking forward to [Oceans Twelve](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0349903/). It was a fine movie, but didn't live up to the previous one. For some reason the soundtrack and cinematography impressed me more than the actual story. Will have to check out the soundtrack when it is available.
