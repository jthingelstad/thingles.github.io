Anybody that has talked to me about music recently knows that I've been working on a huge project to move _all_ of our music to a home media server in MP3 format. A couple of months ago I completed ripping and tagging all of our CDs to the recently built Teraserver (home server with a total of 1.4 terabytes of disk). That was a huge milestone as it involved going through nearly 1,000 CDs.

However, still in front of me was my (relatively small) collection of records -- good ole' vinyl. Well I just completed ripping, splitting into tracks and tagging all my vinyl as well to the media server so I have now **completed my project.** :-)
