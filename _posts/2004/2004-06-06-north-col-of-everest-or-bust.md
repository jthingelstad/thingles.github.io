One of the guys at [MarketWatch](http://www.marketwatch.com/) in our New York office, Rowan Hajaj, recently took off to go to the North Col of Everest. It's funny because I had met him a couple of times and the main thing that I was struck with was his British accent, not a spirit for adventure! :-) Obviously I was wrong.

Anyway, he has a [blog from his trip](http://rowanhajaj.bravejournal.com/). It's a good read, he's a much better writer than I.

I've several times thought it would be great to go to the Everest region. But whenever I hear the details I seem to change my mind.
