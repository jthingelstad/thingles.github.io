I've been having some "fun" (that's in the geekiest sense of the word in this case) playing with some log analysis tools on thingelstad.com. What the heck, I'm curious to see who is hitting what and how often. It's been some time since I've played with any of this and spiders are an interesting challenge. (Spiders for those that aren't aware are the robots that sites like Google and Yahoo use to mine web sites).

Anyway, I was looking at spider activity and this just stunned me.

What is wrong with MSN!? They have hit our site **four times** more than any other spider out there. That seems a bit excessive! Gotta wonder if that is the norm for them.

Anyway, just struck me as odd and rather stupid.
