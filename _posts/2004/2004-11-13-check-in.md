So far, so good in the quest to return to normalcy on the bathroom scale. Mostly the sugar headaches are gone. Body is getting used to eating 4 meals a day and going to bed hungry. I feel good, even a little excited. Not logging food is nice, but I question the effectiveness. I know this is just my obsessive nature kicking in, so it'll be cool. Friday set my starting point at 271.2 lbs and 29.7% body fat. I need to get back to my "100 Pound" mark so that means 232, the math is simple -- I've got 40 lbs to lose. Whew!

To give some perspective here is a view of the last four-and-a-half years. Yes, that really is 340 in the upper left hand corner. I certainly am good at moving the line in either direction. Time to move it on down. :-)

Time for the weekend. This week I really just focused on eating well. Didn't do anything other than my weekly workout with my trainer for exercise. Next week I need to get the exercise rolling.
