#### Ingredients



  * 2 1/2 quarts of water


  * 10 sticks of cinnamon


  * 10 all spice berries


  * 1/2 teaspoon whole cloves


  * 2 1/2 cups sugar


  * 1 1/2 gallons of apple cider


  * 2 quarts of orange juice


  * 1 cup of lemon juice

  1. Bring water, sugar and spices to boil for 10 mins.


  2. Let water mixture cool for 1 hour.


  3. Add apple cider, orange juice and lemon juice.

I store it back in the gallon jugs I buy the apple cider in. The more times you reheat it, the better it seems to taste.
