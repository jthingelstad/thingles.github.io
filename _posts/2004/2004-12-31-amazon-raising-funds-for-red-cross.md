I really don't think the impact of the earthquake and tsunami have or will hit me. It's hard to fathom that kind of disaster and it's so far away. You hear the death tolls and the numbers just seem unreal.

If you are looking for a way to help out in whatever way you can [[Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/).com](http://www.amazon.com/) makes it as simple as one click to donate to the [Red Cross](http://www.redcross.org/). They've already raised over $6 million, correction, $7.6 million now, and counting.

That number makes me embarassed at the [$35 million that the US government has committed](http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/12/30/tsunami.congress.ap/) so far. Hopefully it will be raised substantially.
