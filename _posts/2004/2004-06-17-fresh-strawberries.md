Tammy and her Mom went and picked fresh strawberries today. I've already had at least a pound and a half of them. Fresh, real, vine ripened strawberries are just amazing. Strawberries are by far my favorite fruit and these are like an entirely different thing than what you get at the megamart or even the co-op.

Yum!
