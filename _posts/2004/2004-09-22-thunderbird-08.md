I [mentioned before](/thingelstad/thunderbird) that I've ditched Microsoft Outlook in favor of [Thunderbird](http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/). I've been using [Thunderbird](http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/) for a while now and I'm really liking it. Also, they just released 0.8 of it which has notably added RSS support! Finally I have a worthwhile RSS reader for home use that is integrated. If you haven't checked out [Thunderbird](http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/), it's worth looking into.
