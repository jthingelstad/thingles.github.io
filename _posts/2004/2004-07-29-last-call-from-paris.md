In my last note I mentioned how confusing Paris was to get around. Amazingly enough I think I'm starting to get the hang of it however, of course just as we are only a 'wake up' away from leaving on to Switzerland. We spent much of the last two days zipping around on the [Paris Metro](http://www.paris.org/Metro/) and doing a little more exploring. Tammy did a little shopping today, although the city doesn't really fit her shopping tastes from what she can tell.

### City of Light

Last night we hopped on the metro after dinner to do some night photography. I brought my little portable tripod (thanks REI!) and did some fun 'bulb' exposure shots. For those that are not aware, that means taking pictures where you leave your shutter open for a very long time. These shots were taken with 20 to 30 second exposures. I dig this stuff probably because it's really easy to create a shot that looks so cool. I've put three above that I liked particularly well. Paris get's to be both the _City of Light_ and the _City of Love_! Pretty lucky, both light and love!

### Anniversary Art

Some of you may know that Tammy and I decided when we got married that our wedding presents were going to be art, and that after that we wouldn't get each other anniversary presents but instead together get a piece of art. As you'll know from reading our site this is only our 2nd anniversary, but the tradition continues. We went out today to find a piece that we really enjoyed and came out even better than expected. The beginning of the search was a bit disappointing as we got excited about 15,000â‚¬ paintings that we obviously weren't bringing home. We then returned to a gallery we had visited shortly right by the Louvre called [Art Club](http://www.artclub.fr/). We found a a piece called _Allez Saute!_ that we thought was great -- and now it's ours! It's by a young Parisienne artist named Corniere. She had a number of pieces but this one we particularly liked and it fit our budget.

### Kilometers

We've decided that we like kilometers. Let's get these in the states as well. They are great for bike riding. The numbers are so much higher and they just go by so fast! Plus you can use the abbreviations k's which is just so cool. While we are at it, let's chuck the pounds and ounces and go for grams as well. Although, I don't find ordering a 240g steak nearly as exciting as a _half-pound_ steak.

My feet and legs are tired from walking around the city all day lately. That's maybe not such a great way to _begin_ a week-long hiking trip in the Alpes! We head out on the train to Zurich tomorrow morning. I don't expect to be online much, if at all, so you probably won't see anything else from us until we return. See you all soon, when we have to return to _reality!_
