We just got back from watching Stage 3 of the [Great River Energy Bicycle Festival](http://www.minnbikefestival.com/). This is the Minneapolis downtown criterium. It looked like they might have to cancel it as the race approached because of the weather. There were very ominous skies and the rain was pretty hard for a while. The race did get off about 45 minutes late, but it did finally get off. It's so exciting to see pro level cyclists just hammering along in a big "train of pain". I stood on the side of the road on one of the sprint laps and the wind coming off the peloton was awesome.

Going to go see the final stage on Sunday in Stillwater as well.
