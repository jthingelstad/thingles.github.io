I've really not cared for Outlook Express for quite a while now so I'm giving [Mozilla Thunderbird](http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/) a shot. So far, it's pretty good. Have to change some of my habits around keyboard shortcuts and the like. The news reader is much better than the Outlook one, but that isn't saying much. We'll see how this goes.
