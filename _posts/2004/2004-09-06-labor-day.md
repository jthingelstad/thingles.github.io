Labor day is such a bittersweet holiday. It is always a fun time, but for those of us in the Northern climates it signals the end of the summer and the coming of fall. This year it comes with even more bitterness since we have had such a sad excuse for a summer this year. It feels like fall is in full swing. As we were traveling this weekend it was obvious that the leaves were about to change. I bet it will be full fall color season in a week or two.

Tammy and I went to [Lanesboro](http://www.lanesboro.com/) for much of the holiday weekend. We went to explore the [Root River & Harmony-Preston Valley Sate Trail](http://files.dnr.state.mn.us/maps/state_trails/tra00730.pdf). Lanesboro is the perfect place to explore this more than 50 miles of wonderfully paved bike trails. Out of here we had three days of great riding. We started Friday night with a short ride from Lanesboro to Fountain for 22.4 miles round trip. Then on Saturday we did a longer ride from Lanesboro to [Houston](http://www.houstonmnchamber.com/) which was 62.2 miles round trip and finished on Sunday with a ride to [Harmony](http://www.harmony.mn.us/) and back for 45 miles total. We got around 130 miles in for the three days and had some really great trails.

We stayed at the [Habberstad House Bed & Breakfast](http://www.habberstadhouse.com/). This is a great B&B! It was at the top of the list with our favorite B&Bs that we have ever stayed in. The owners, Nancy and Dave, are fabulous. The rooms are great, and breakfast was wonderful. We will definitely revisit upon a return to Lanesboro.

We stopped by the [Cornucopia Art Center](http://www.lanesboroarts.org/) while we were there and saw some work by a Superior, WI artist named Erik Pearson that we really liked. We can't wait for it to arrive. It's unique and different than our other art and I think it's going to be great fun.

We returned to the cities and a lot of rain. Due to the rain we ended up not going to the [Jack Johnson](http://www.jackjohnsonmusic.com/) concert we had tickets to and instead went to see [Collateral](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0369339/). Good movie, lots of action. It was a bit predictable though.

On Labor Day Tammy ran the [MDRA Victory 10k](http://www.raceberryjam.com/victory.html). I got up early and rode my bike up there to get some miles in and watch her do the run. I really don't like getting up at 6:30 am on a holiday, but it also lets you get so much done in the day! I had a nice ride to the run and then cheered on runners as they went by. I saw a shirt for this movement called [Run Against Bush](http://www.runagainstbush.org/). Pretty amazing how _motivated_ our current president has made people, myself included.

All in all, a great, relaxing holiday! I put up some miscellaneous photos if you're interested.
