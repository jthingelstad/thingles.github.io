I just finished reading what has to be one of the stranger books I've read. _[Stiff](http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0393050939)_ is in a way like an owners guide for future cadaver owners. That is to say, all of us. Mary Roach goes into impressive, if not at times unsettling, detail about the processes by which cadavers contribute to education, safety and numerous other ventures. It is initially off-putting but after a few chapters is very interesting.

I found the references to pre-1900 practices of regarding cadavers to be alarming and the advancements of recent years interesting. Perhaps most interesting was the next to last chapter regarding ecological burial. Most interesting I think was understanding how radically different various cultures work with cadavers and in general human remains.

Interesting read, glad to have read it, don't think I'll read it a second time.
