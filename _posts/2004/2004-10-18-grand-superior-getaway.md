This past weekend we spent our weekend up on the North Shore just north of Two Harbors, MN at the [Grand Superior Lodge](http://www.grandsuperior.com/). Tammy and I drove up on Friday with a dinner stop at [Bellisio's](http://www.grandmasrestaurants.com/bellisios.htm) in Canal Park in Duluth. Tammy's family joined us and we turned this weekend into the first Olson family vacation.

We had breakfast at the [Rustic Inn Cafe](http://www.rusticinncafe.com/) just across from the lodge on Saturday and then made our way to [Tettegouche State Park](http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/tettegouche/) to check out the falls. The weather was very cold, just barely above freezing. The hiking was scrapped because of the weather being so cold. We celebrated two brother-in-law birthdays that evening with dinner back in Duluth at [Angie's Cantina](http://www.grandmasrestaurants.com/angies.htm).

Sunday morning we went to [Gooseberry Falls](http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/gooseberry_falls/). A trip to the North Shore isn't complete without seeing Gooseberry and the weather was much better this day. We hiked out to the shore of Lake Superior and admired the water for a while. Everybody else took off to head back home that afternoon and Tammy and I spent another day at the lodge on our own just reading and watching a movie.

We had a great breakfast at [Betty's Pies](http://www.bettyspies.com/), another North Shore staple, and then headed back to the cities. It was a nice time, if a little cold. I put some pictures up from the weekend as well.
