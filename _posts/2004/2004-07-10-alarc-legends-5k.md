Tammy and I did the [ALARC Legends 5k](http://www.alarc.com/legendsrace.htm) this morning. Tammy has just started taking a running class with [ALARC](http://www.alarc.com/) and they had an included pancake breakfast after the run which was enough for me to get on board. :-)

Tammy ran it in 25:13 and I around 26:30. It was a nice run, a little humid and I was glad it started at 7:30am to avoid any heat.

This run is called Legends because they invite a number of Minnesota runners that have had an impact in the running world. A number of marathon record holders were there as well as a 90 year old dude out running with all of us. I hope I'm so energetic at 90!
