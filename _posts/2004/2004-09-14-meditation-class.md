I've been referenced several times to the benefits of meditation but I've never really understood it. Mainly because I didn't understand how sitting still could benefit you so much. Also, I find it almost impossible to do. I decided that I wanted to give it a try so Tammy and I signed up for an [introduction to meditation class](http://www.yogacentermpls.com/8_med.html) at the [Yoga Center of Minneapolis](http://www.yogacentermpls.com/).

We had our first class last night and it felt a little goofy but I left the place feeling a level of relaxation that I typically only feel after a massage. As I expected, it was very hard for me to quiet my mind or ego as the instructor says. I'm going to keep trying though. The class is eight weeks and we will learn several different techniques for reaching a meditative state. Last night we did a mental chant of _huang-sah_ which just means swan. You think _huang_ on inhale and _sah_ on exhale. It does work.

I'm looking forward to the next class!
