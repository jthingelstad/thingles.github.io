The People's Republic of California is an interesting state. While there are many referendums and interesting progressive groups in the state that sometimes make no sense to me, I was excited to see the state fighting what I feel is the good fight on two fronts.

California communities have actually been [fighting off the WalMart](http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/mar2004/nf2004034_0106_db035.htm) takeover of the country. Hat's off to them for not welcoming such a scavenger business into their economies.

Also, I just found out about [Senate Bill 19](http://www.nojunkfood.org/policy/sb19_summary.html) in California that mandates certain qualities of food given to kids in public schools. I'd love to see how few McDonalds menu items would be allowed under this.
