Tammy and I just finished the [Easy Does It](http://www.hazelden.org/servlet/hazelden/events/event.html?page_id=25080&event_calendar_id=13978&event_schedule_id=17732) 5-mile run in Plymouth. We were going to do the [Rally for the Refuge](http://www.friendsofmnvalley.org/rally.htm) 5k mainly since we did the very first one last year so we could be repeat runners for the whole event. However, our friends Alice and John mentioned the Easy Does It was a lot of fun so we decided to do that instead. It was a great day, and the course was really good. I finished in 46:38 and Tammy finished around 43:30 (she doesn't time herself). Race results aren't posted yet.
