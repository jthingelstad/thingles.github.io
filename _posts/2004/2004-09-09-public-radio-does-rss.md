I stumbled across this on the Internet tonight. Guess I just never thought to check, but [National Public Radio](http://www.npr.org/) exposes a lot of content via RSS. Also, [Minnesota Public Radio](http://minnesota.publicradio.org/) also has an RSS feed through them. [Go get some good news feeds](http://www.npr.org/rss/)!
