I've been belaboring the idea of getting an iPod for months. Really, this is probably one of the hardest consumer electronics decisions I've tried to make recently. Well, the decision making process was shortcut today when I found myself to be the winner of an iPod Mini! Yeah!

Some know that I got my start on computers on the Apple //c and then the Macintosh. Deep down in this jaded IT professionals heart is a soft spot for all things Apple. I've got a similar soft spot for all things Unix as well which makes one wonder why I spend my entire day looking at Microsoft dominated systems. Anyway, that's another blog entry.

Opening up the iPod Mini was a reminder of how Apple "gets it". They realize the user experience starts with opening the box. The packaging is even cool! Everything was made to be really simple. In fact, I found that when I was having a hard time I was essentially thinking too much about what I was trying to do.

Anyway, I'm only about an hour into using it but I love the iPod Mini. I'm worried that love may turn to infatuation and I'll be getting a 40G "big" iPod to go with it. iTunes is a great player package. Unfortunately it is so much more intuitive than any of the Windows players.

More to come as I use it, but the immediate reaction is "sweet!"
