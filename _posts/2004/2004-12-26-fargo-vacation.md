Like a large percentage of my office mates and I'm guessing the country at large I'm taking this coming week off. Had a personal day that I needed to use before the end of the year and with the combination of holidays it was easy to stretch a couple of days into a big break from the office.

We didn't want to do anything too exotic so we decided to keep our downtime in line with our holiday plans. This year was a trip back to North Dakota with my family so Tammy started investigating options. We arrived tonight in Fargo, ND where we are going to spend three nights and relax. You might be wondering why Fargo? Well, we built the entire stay in Fargo around a hotel and I have to tell you upon check-in we were not let down.

We are spending the next three nights at the [Hotel Donaldson](http://www.hoteldonaldson.com/) in downtown Fargo. We reserved the "Big Dog" suite _(go to the website, click on sleep on the top, click the down arrow by the picture until you see Room #10)_ and were shown to our new home-away-from-home with big grins on our faces. The space is amazing. Our suite has 17 foot ceilings, hardwood floors, living room with dining area separate from the master bedroom. Huge plasma TV with everything you would want. Even the WiFi is deluxe with 802.11g. The Hotel Donaldson only has 17 rooms and each room is unique with local art and exquisite accommodations.

Do I dare tell you that this room is less than the box with a bed I usually stay in when I travel for business to the coasts? I can honestly say you could build a trip around this hotel. I've gushed enough and it's late. I'm hopeful the rest of Fargo can live up to this hotel.
