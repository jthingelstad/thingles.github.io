On Friday night we went to see [The Incredibles](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0317705/) on opening night. We erred on the side of caution and went to the later show to avoid the overflow of kids that were sure to go to the earlier one. However, on the flipside Tammy found it impossible to stay awake. Somehow we have really turned into early risers.

Pixar did a great job on this one. I remembered back to [Toy Story](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114709/) and it's amazing how far animation technology has come. The nice thing is that you no longer even think about the fact that this is all computer generated (unless you want to), it's completely transparent which I think is proof that this stuff has matured.

The story was fun and funny. It was surprisingly longer than I expected. I guess I'm used to these animated things being 80-90 minutes and at 105 this was notably longer (or maybe it was the later hour!). Anyway, fun flick for all, recommend it.
