[![What’s The Matter With Kansas?](/assets/posts/{{ page.date | date: "%Y" }}/040601frank-30011.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0805073396/?tag=thingelstad-20)I heard about Thomas Frank's book [What's the Matter With Kansas?](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0805073396/?tag=thingelstad-20) on [The Daily Show](http://www.comedycentral.com/tv_shows/thedailyshowwithjonstewart/) shortly after the presidential election. The author caught my interest and I picked up a copy of the book. I found this book to be a great read. He does a good job of looking at historical precedent and taking apart what has changed.
From the book:

<blockquote>A while back the _Wall Street Journal_ ran an essay about a place where hatred trumps bread, where a manipulative ruling class has for decades exploited an impoverished people while simultaneously fostering in them a culture of victimization that steers this people's fury back persistently toward a shadowy, cosmopolitan Other. In this tragic land unassuageable cultural grievances are elevated inexplicably over solid material ones, and basic economic self-interest is eclipsed by juicy myths of national authenticity and righteousness wronged.

Frank does not write from the center. He clearly is pro-liberal, pro-union and pro-choice. However, the text does not turn into self-righteous drivel. In fact, he takes issue with the lack of liberal attitudes in the democratic party -- pointing out the weakness that now dominates it.
