_Tammy and I are in a smoky Internet cafe in Grenoble..._

Sounds like the beginning to a good novel. :-) However, this keyboard is **french!** And it is shockingly similqr yet different. Forget qwerty, it's azerty!

Anyway just letting people know we have arrived. The keyboard and smoke are too much! We ride tomorrow...

Au revoir!
