We did the [Minnetonka Summer Festival 8k](http://www.raceberryjam.com/tonka.html) run this morning. This is the first time we have done this run (two years ago we did the 2 mile fun run that is part of this event). The course was fairly hilly and challenging but an enjoyable run nonetheless.

The pancake breakfast afterwards was a bit cheesey but very good and exceptionally cheap.
