It's amazing to me how hostile some drivers are to people on bicycles. [This article](http://www.startribune.com/stories/462/4840168.html) in the Star Tribune highlights another recent hit & run. It just makes me sick.

You can help, even if you don't ride a bicycle. If you see someone driving aggressively against a cycling you can [report the unsafe driving](https://www.dps.state.mn.us/patrol/unsafe/report.htm) over the web to the police. Also, you can support local [advocacy groups for pedestrian and bicycle safety](http://www.bikeped.org/).
