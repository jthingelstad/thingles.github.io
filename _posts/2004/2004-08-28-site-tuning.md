I've been having a lot of fun lately tuning up our site. I've been able to "stand on the shoulders of giants" leveraging a lot of open source stuff and cut & paste hacking and slashing. Newest addition is linking to our photo albums with picture highlights. Huge thanks to [Edo van Vliet](http://blog.swiftalpha.com/) for [posting code to do this](http://blog.swiftalpha.com/articles/184.aspx).
