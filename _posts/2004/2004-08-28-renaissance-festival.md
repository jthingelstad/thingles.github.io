We made our 2nd trip of the year to the [Renaissance Festival](http://www.renaissancefest.com/minnesota-main.htm), this time with Tracy and Jeff. The RenFest is like a one day vacation. Great time to laze around in the afternoon, have some cheap wine and enjoy some relaxation. Check out the pictures.
