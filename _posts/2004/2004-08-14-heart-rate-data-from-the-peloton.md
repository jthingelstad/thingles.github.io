Many of you know that I'm a gear junkie. I record my heart rate on all my rides and runs. Why? Because I can, not because I need to.

[Polar](http://www.polarusa.com/) just put up a webpage with [heart rate data from a few riders](http://tdf.polar.fi/tourdefrance/heartrates.html) in this years [Tour de France](http://www.letour.com/indexus.html). It's really interesting. It's also amazing to me how low their heart rates are even on the hard climbs!
