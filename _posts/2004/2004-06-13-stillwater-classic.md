On our way back from our camping excursion we stopped in Stillwater and watched the final stage of the Great River Energy Bicycle Festival. Today was the horrendous criterium in historic downtown Stillwater. There are a couple of climbs on the course including a brutal one that is over 25% grade. The race was fast and seemed to be more competitive than other years. The looks on the pro riders faces reminded me that this was no walk in the park.

It's great to have one pro level bike race in Minnesota. I hope it continues to improve!
