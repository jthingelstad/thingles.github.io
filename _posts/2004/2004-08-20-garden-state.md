Tonight Tammy and I took it easy and went to a movie. We decided to check out [Garden State](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0333766/). I really liked the movie. If you enjoyed movies like [Lost in Translation](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0335266/) or [Niagara, Niagara](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119780/), I'm almost positive that you will like Garden State. I left the movie also thinking that it reminded me a lot of [The Graduate](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061722/), even though I couldn't figure out why.

It took me a moment to get over Zach Braff. Braff wrote, directed and starred in this. I'm not that big of a fan of [Scrubs](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0285403/), and while this movie has nothing to do with Scrubs I kept on thinking about it with him on the screen in front of me. However, given the quality of this movie and that it was his deal, I left with much more respect for him.

I'm tempted to get the soundtrack. The music in the film was perfect.
