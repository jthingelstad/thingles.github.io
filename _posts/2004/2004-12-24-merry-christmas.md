Tammy and I begin our Christmas journey today. We alternate Christmas and this year is a trip to my family so we'll be driving a long ways to [Minot, ND](http://www.visitminot.org/) tonight and then continuing to my grandparents farm outside of [Lignite, ND](http://www.lignitend.com/).

**Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays!**

_PS - I failed again to do a holiday letter and get Christmas cards out to friends and family. However, I feel really good about next year!_
