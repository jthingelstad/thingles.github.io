What happened to refrigeration when Europe got their hands on it? There is nothing that is really cold here! I've been on a search for "la glacie" (ice) and anytime I get my hands on some I drink a half-dozen glasses of cold water. Even the soda out of vending machines isn't really cold, but just cool.

I'm trying not to be an ugly American on this one. I've found France to be great. But c'mon, bring on the ice!

Tammy is obsessed with water.
