Last night Tammy and I went to [The Forgotten](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0356618/). The movie was moderately entertaining, however I certainly wouldn't make a huge effort to see it. Renting the DVD would probably be fine. The theme of the movie reminded me a bit of [Dark City](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118929/). The movie successfully provides a number of shocking adrenaline scenes that will definitely make you jump in your seat. The rest of the time it takes an eerie, 3rd party perspective for the camera. If you're bored and looking for something pretty simple but exciting, check it out.
