Every year [TCBC](http://www.mtn.org/tcbc/) holds it's annual 4th of July ride called the Watermelon Ride. It's aptly named since there is a lunch afterward where large amounts of watermelon are made available. Tammy and I had not done this ride in the past but had wanted to. It is a great route, very flat which makes it a very managable fun ride for the holiday weekend. Two ride options are available with milage of 25 or 55 miles. We did the longer route. Couldn't have asked for a nicer day on the bike to get some comfortable miles in.
