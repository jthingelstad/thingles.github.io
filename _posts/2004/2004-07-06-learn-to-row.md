Tammy and I are taking the "Learn to Row" class at the [Minneapolis Rowing Club](http://www.mplsrowing.org/ ). Tonight was our third class which was our first class to really get out on the water. We are taking the class with 10 people and learning to row a sweep eight. We will also have one day where we will scull which is the one-person boats.

I got a little uneasy when the boat got wobbly (not set). Our instructor reassured us that it is very hard to flip an eight, but I wasn't buying it.

Rowing is pretty fun so far. I'll try to get some pictures on our weekend classes.
