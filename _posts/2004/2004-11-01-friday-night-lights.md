[Friday Night Lights](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0390022/) is the movie that you get when you mix [Hoosiers](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091217/) with [Any Given Sunday](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0146838/). The movie has the great but completely unrealistic action shots that make [Any Given Sunday](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0146838/) so much fun. This is high school though, not pro or even college, which really reminded me of [Hoosiers](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091217/). It even had the alcoholic Dad that embarasses and abuses his son subplot where he comes clean in the battle to "win State".

I did like it though. It was an entertaining way to spend a couple of hours and even had me pumping my fist a couple of times at the choreographed action on the screen.
