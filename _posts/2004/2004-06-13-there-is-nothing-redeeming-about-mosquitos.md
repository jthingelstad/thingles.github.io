We just got back from a quick overnight car camping trip to [St. Croix State Park](http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/st_croix/). The beauty of car camping is that you do really bring everything _and_ the kitchen sink with you. We had our large tent which I affectionately refer to as "the condo" and blow-up mattress. The weather was fine even after a very rainy Friday.

We went for a long hike on Saturday covering a total of 9.6 miles. The first three miles of the trail, just like our actual campsite, was swarming with [mosquitos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito). They were really terrible, and turned the first bit of our hike into an unplanned _speed hike_ as we tried to stay a step in front of them. They were in fact so bad that it actually drove Tammy to use [DEET](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEET) for the first time. She hates the stuff -- in fact is downright scared of it. This was no simple first time either since she used my Jungle Juice which is 95% DEET unlike your typical 10-15% found in most bug sprays. Enough with the _skeeter_ talk.

Our hike was great. We had a wonderful campfire and good food. We broke camp right after completing breakfast on the new Coleman camp stove that I just "had to have". Made pancakes, eggs and sausage (hey, this _is_ car camping!). After leaving the jungle behind we went to Hinckley and did a couple of hours on our road bikes on the [Willard-Munger State Trail](http://www.munger-trail.com/) out of Hinckley.

Aside from the mosquitos, it was a good trip. With the mosquitos, it was less than fun!
