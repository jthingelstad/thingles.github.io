I was pleased to wake up this morning feeling better than yesterday. A good nights sleep thanks to Nyquil and variety of other incantations seemed to have helped me out. Hopefully Tammy wont get any whiff of this quick cold.

The car is completely loaded and we're just waiting to head to the airport. Tonight we sleep on the plane and wake up tomorrow in Paris! Tammy is starting to get really worried about the flight. She hates flying. It seems like we have half of our house with us for this trip. Putting both cycling and hiking in a vacation means you end up needing to bring a lot of stuff with you.

The [Tour de France](http://www.letour.com/indexus.html) has been awesome the last two days with [Lance](http://www.lancearmstrong.com/) showing that he does indeed have what it takes. I'm terribly excited about seeing it all in person!

The next time you hear anything from us will be from France!
