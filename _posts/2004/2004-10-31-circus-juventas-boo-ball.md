Tammy and I volunteered at the [Circus Juventas Boo Ball](http://www.circusjuventas.com/booball.html) last night. I think it's a fairly common thing that volunteering for small to medium sized events is generally a somewhat chaotic and unorganized event. We were initially given the task of "walk around and just help out with things" which was quickly turning into "you just get into the event for free" which I felt a little bad about. After all, didn't seem like volunteering to me. In the end though we were asked to help direct people as they came to the event to get them into the right line -- will call, cash or credit card. In short, we had a job that would have been done better by some moderately decent inanimate signage.

Some observations from our evening of volunteering...

The Boo Ball is a 21+ event and working the door we did get to check out all the costumes as people came in. The men didn't really have any rhyme or reason to their costumes. There was a really good mummy and some notable scary looking costumes, but no prevailing theme. However, for the women the theme was clearly, shall we say, revealing? It seems that Halloween events must really be an excuse to look as _trampy_ as you can without worrying what your girlfriends might say. I'm not complaining of course, this is just an observation.

Additionally, you would expect that queuing people into the right line would be a fairly simple task. And in fact, early comers to the event were fairly observant. However, you could tell the few drinks at the bar before hand as people arrived later significantly degraded their ability to comprehend anything quickly. A couple of times I thought I was explaining particle physics to someone looking for an answer to "Do you have tickets already?".

The event was pretty cool. I'd recommend going to the [Boo Ball](http://www.circusjuventas.com/booball.html) as a participant in the future. If you are curious how the heck we ended up volunteering at [Circus Juventas](http://www.circusjuventas.com/) it is because Tammy and her sister are taking their [adult circus classes](http://www.circusjuventas.com/adultclasses.html). She loves it. I keep telling her to write something about it here, but she is shy. :-)
