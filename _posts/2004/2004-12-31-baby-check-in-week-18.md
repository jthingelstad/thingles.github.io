I haven't chatted much about the baby since the [initial announcement]({{site.url}}{% link _posts/2004/2004-11-25-thingelstads-announce-pregnancy.md %}). It seems a little weird that you have this life changing thing going on but there is little in the way of noticeable differences right away. Tammy is just now starting to show so it doesn't seem _real_ yet.

Tammy and I had our regular appointment with the [midwife](http://www.northmetromidwives.com/) yesterday. All is well in babyland! This was the first time I was able to hear the heartbeat and it was pounding away! The midwife said that the static occasionally was the baby moving. Little tyke was moving around quite a bit! Tammy and I are bypassing the majority of the screening tests. We decided that we do not want to deal with the high false positive rates.

In a couple of weeks we'll have the ultrasound done where we get to find out the sex and make sure everything is where it's supposed to be.

We both have found it amazing how when other people say they are pregnant you just assume that a few months later they'll have a baby. When it's us we are sort of on pins and needles that nothing goes wrong. It seems far from a sure thing. However, hearing the heartbeat yesterday and now that Tammy is starting to show sure makes me feel good!
