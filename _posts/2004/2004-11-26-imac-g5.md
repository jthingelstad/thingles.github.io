Those of you that have had to endure me rambling on and on about computers at some time probably know that I cut my teeth in the world of Apple. Actually, my computer lineage is like this:

I was a huge Mac fan (err, zealot?) when that wondrous thing called multi-finder was released. I was eager to see the first color Mac. I really like these machines, but I got so frustrated with the sad excuse for an operating system that I had to bail. Additionally, they just don't carry any weight in the business world.

I've been excited about Mac OS X for a while now and I finally took the plunge. They had a one day sale and I decided it was time to get an iMac. I got the 20" iMac G5. It's the most visible computer in our house so I appreciate the aesthetics. Plus, it's just a lot of fun.

I just got it set up tonight. It'll take a while to stop fumbling around in this thing. I'll share my re-acquaintance experiences as it goes.
