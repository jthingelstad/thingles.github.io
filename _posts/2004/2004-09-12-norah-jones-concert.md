Last night Tammy and I went to the [Norah Jones](http://www.norahjones.com/) concert at the Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul. It was a good concert. The opener, [Amos Lee](http://www.amoslee.com/), did a great job and Norah and the Handsome Band were very good. We were totally exhausted however after riding the century earlier in the day and didn't wait for the encore instead opting to get out and home as soon as possible to fall fast asleep.

Both Tammy and I decided that Norah Jones is a studio artist though, not so much a live artist. Particularly in a venue so large. She seemed like she wasn't real sure what to do with all these people and all the space. I think seeing her in a small, intimate venue would probably be fine, but I don't think her music, or style, are well suited to an arena size space.
