On Saturday we found ourselves doing something that we both recalled we hadn't done probably in a decade. We were hopping into the car to drive hundreds of miles just to see a performance. Now, a decade ago I may have been found doing a road trip like this for a punk rock concert, today we found ourselves driving 360 miles to see [Ira Glass](http://www.barclayagency.com/glass.html) of [This American Life](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/).

We headed out on I-94 and went straight from home to Milwaukee. As we were driving I noted again that either Wisconsin has tremendously more road kill or they do not do a good job of cleaning up the roads. We saw more than twenty deer in various states of decay on the side of the road. Driving I-94 West instead of East for a dozen hours as I've done many times you will see a deer on the side of the road dead, but it's rare. For some reason Wisconsin peppers the side of the road to a disturbing amount.

We arrived in Milwaukee and checked into the [Wyndham hotel downtown](http://www.wyndham.com/hotels/MKEMC/main.wnt). The hotel was perfect as it was in the same building as the [Pabst Theater](http://www.pabsttheater.com/). We had dinner with a friend of Tammy's family, Jennifer McDaniel. Tammy was friends with Jennifer when she was like 9 months old. We had dinner at the Water Street Brewery and then walked back to the theater for the evening with Ira Glass.

We saw Ira Glass perform about a year-and-a-half ago in Minneapolis and were amazed by how great it was. The show is about how they make [This American Life](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/). We both love the show -- we listened to five episodes of it on our drive. The show that we saw was the same structure as the one that we saw last time, however it was still great. The content inside the structure was updated. I can't encourage you enough to go see one of his performances.

By the way, the [Pabst Theater](http://www.pabsttheater.com/) we found out while there is the 4th oldest operating theater in the country. It was a very nice place with the exception of pretty tight seating as is common in old theaters.
