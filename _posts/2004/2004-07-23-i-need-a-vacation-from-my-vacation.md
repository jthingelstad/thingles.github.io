I'm writing this entry on the bus ride back to Paris. We got up again at 6:00 am so we could head into Paris for the final stage of the [Tour de France](http://www.letour.com/indexus.html). I'm looking forward to seeing [Lance](http://www.lancearmstrong.com/) win a record setting sixth tour. This leg of our trip is about to end and that will be fine. We've been up at 6:00 am every day, riding, standing outside watching the tour and typically not getting back until 9:00 pm for a quick dinner and back to sleep. The next few days of more leisurely activity in Paris will be appreciated. I certainly will not miss this bus either.
