I've now entered the world of digital video in addition to the digital photography one I've been in for some time. My wife was cool enough to get me the [Panasonic PV-GS400 digital camcorder](http://www2.panasonic.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/vModelDetail?displayTab=O&storeId=11251&catalogId=11005&itemId=70622&catGroupId=17171&modelNo=PV-GS400&surfModel=PV-GS400). This is a very slick 3CCD unit with more bells and whistles than I know what to do with at this time. It even takes 4 megapixel stills! I've been playing with it over Christmas, taking some really dumb video and realizing that it's hard to fake your way through video production. :-)

Now this will of course spark a fury of other things I need to learn and play with including a better disk subsystem for my PC since moving those big video files around will be oh so slow. This is how it always works -- fun!

This present signifies my first "Dad Gift". I am now fully equiped to stand with all the other geeky Dads spinning hours of video of their kids that nobody will ever want to watch other than them. I'm also very okay with this.

Other Christmas gifts this year included a couple of Logitech wireless Xbox controllers (and they are great!), an awesome clay poker chip set, Six Feet Under Season 2, great books and numerous other fun things. Not to mention a lot of great time with friends and family. Can't really ask for much more!
