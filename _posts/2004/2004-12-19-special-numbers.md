Do you know what a [googol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googol) is? A googol is a very, very large number. 1.0 * 10100. Or, in long-hand...

10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,  
000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000

I remember googol from some trivial bit of knowledge in my "math geek" high school days. I just stumbled across it again in my reading and it's fascinating me. I'm reading all about natural numbers which are normal numbers like 0, 1, 2, 3 and so on. Not the supposedly _unnatural_ numbers like 3.14159265. Decimals and fractions are straight out. The _most_ natural are the prime numbers. Once you are a prime you are in a class of your own, however, there is even a pecking order in there with a variety of _special_ types of primes. While it's not a prime hunt, [Sierpinski numbers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpinski_number) are one example of this that [I'm currently helping hunt](http://www.seventeenorbust.com/stats/users/user.mhtml?userID=8349) for.

After stumbling on googol I had to try my favorite [Google](http://www.google.com/) function ever, the [Google Calculator](http://www.google.com/help/features.html#calculator). There is no connection between [Google](http://www.google.com/) and googol other than sharing the same letters and both sounding like something a 8 month old baby may emit during feeding. I was not disappointed, [[Google](http://www.google.com/) Calculator let me know exactly what a googol is](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&q=googol). The calculator even defies the 32-bit (or even 64-bit) world and at least pretends to tell me things like [googol mod 154351](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&q=googol+mod+154351). However, it has yet to give me a number that doesn't evenly divide into a googol so I'm tempted to test it to see if it's really doing it right. Maybe a prime number generator built off of [Google](http://www.google.com/)? Would probably be really slow but could make a great article for [Wired magazine](http://www.wired.com/). :-)

I now have a new favorite [Google](http://www.google.com/) Calculator query (replacing [the answer to life the universe and everything](http://www.google.com/search?q=answer+to+life+the+universe+and+everything)):

mass of the earth * (googol * speed of light) / pi

which it effortlessly tells me is 

**(mass of Earth * (googol * the speed of light)) / pi = 5.70099405 Ã— 10132 m kg / s**

which is completely meaningless and entirely useless, but very fun.
