Tammy and I enthusiastically went to see [I Heart Huckabees](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0356721/) last night at the [Uptown](http://www.landmarktheatres.com/market/Minneapolis/UptownTheatre.htm). We had seen a preview a while ago and it was completely confusing but hooked us in a big way. I won't try to explain this movie. You can imagine that a movie that is focused around [_existential_](http://oldsci.eiu.edu/psychology/Spencer/Existential.html)_ detectives_ may be a little odd. It is. And the cast is great. Highly recommended.

The movie isn't in general release yet, it will be released this Friday. A hidden bonus of seeing it in limited release were some free Huckabees t-shirts. :-)
