Tammy and I went to the [Edina Art Fair](http://www.50thandfrance.com/2004artfair.htm) today. The fair is bigger than it has been in recent years. The quality of the art was both better and worse. We were excited to see the [Yardbirds](http://www.crittercreations.com/) there (we have a few of their things) and we couldn't help but get a picture from one of the local artists that we thought was very cool (picture below). However, there were a couple of stands that were terrible. We couldn't figure out how they had gotten in through the judges. One was selling stuffed snakes from Taiwan!

The weather was great, if not a bit too hot.
