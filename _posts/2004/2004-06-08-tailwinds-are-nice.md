I've been commuting to work on my bike again. It's such a great way for me to get to work and with the superb trails that are at my disposal it's really a shame for me not to ride in. On the way home tonight I felt like I was in paradise as I pedaled down the path. I was cruising along at 22 mph and the gears were turning over so easily.

At that time I was reminded of something that I heard when I was at Hellweek in 2001. An older cyclist that I was riding one of the centuries with joked with me that "Whenever you are enjoying it, you've got a tailwind." Tonight as I rode along the path feeling light as air these words came back to me. I hesitantly looked to the side of the trail and there I saw the grass gently but firmly bent in my direction from a steady wind.

I had proven this saying true yet again.
