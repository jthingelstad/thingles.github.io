We've decided that before we go on our next big road trip we are going to take the jump to satellite radio. I've spent some time this evening doing searches on the two providers in this market -- [XM](http://www.xmradio.com/index.jsp) and [Sirius](http://www.sirius.com/). This is so similar to the [Dish Network](http://www.dishnetwork.com/) v. [DirecTV](http://www.directv.com/). Aargh!

It seems like XM is better if you want premium content and more repeaters, but concerns about commercials and [Clear Channel](http://www.clearchannel.com/) has an ownership interest. Sirius is supposed to have much better music quality (both in programming and quality of encoding), fewer commercials and importantly they have an exclusive with [NPR](http://www.npr.org/).

Oh the horrors of making these consumer electronics decisions. Any suggestions?
