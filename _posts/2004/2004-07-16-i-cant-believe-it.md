I got a cold the day before we go to Europe! Argh!

It's [Chris Tersteeg](http://www.tersteeg.org/)'s fault -- he gave it to me. I've got a _depth charge_ of vitamins, medicine and other herbal things trying to get me better. Hopefully it'll pass soon.

Bikes are boxed up, bags are 95% packed and carry-on is ready to go. Tomorrow we sleep by the Eiffel Tower.
