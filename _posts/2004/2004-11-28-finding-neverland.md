[![](/assets/posts/{{ page.date | date: "%Y" }}/o_Finding%2520Neverland.jpg)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0308644/)[Finding Neverland](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0308644/) is a really great movie. We went to see it today during a matinee and it seems others had this idea as well. The movie was in one of the smaller theatres and it was packed for a 2:00pm matinee. Johnny Depp is great in this story about the making of Peter Pan.
I will not try to summarize the story only to tell you that there were very few dry eyes leaving the theater. The story takes a sad and heartfelt turn at the end.

You will not regret parting with your $8 for this one.
