At this very moment the painters are removing the plastic covering from all the windows in our house. **We can see again!** It's amazing how odd your house feels when all of a sudden the windows are all opaque and you cannot see out. It's like living in a sensory deprivation chamber (okay, it's not that bad but it was annoying).

For some reason the garage door is having a terrible time opening. It is behaving like it weighs a thousand pounds more than it did before.

Pictures to come soon!
