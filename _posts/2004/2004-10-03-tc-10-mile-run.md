I got to be the spectator today while Tammy did her longest running event ever. Today was the [Twin Cities Marathon](http://www.twincitiesmarathon.org/) and Tammy ran the sister event in the morning called the [TC10](http://www.twincitiesmarathon.org/exec/twincities/10_mile_run.cfm?publicationID=39) or the _[Shortcut to the Capital](http://www.twincitiesmarathon.org/exec/twincities/10_mile_run.cfm?publicationID=39)._ Her longest run prior to this was a 9 mile training run and she wasn't starting with a lot of confidence this morning. She has had trouble running because her knee has been hurting every time she runs.

Today was no exception, her knee started hurting her after a couple of miles but she kept going. She was able to make the whole 10 miles and averaged just below 10 minute miles. She was disappointed since she felt the run wasn't too bad, but her knee was absolutely killing her. Without the injury, she felt she could have done so much better. She's limping around fairly badly now. I'm sure it will be better in a couple of days, but she'll need to take it easy for a bit.

I was very proud of her either way -- and it was kind of fun to be the spectator and photographer.
