Tammy and I went to see the new version of [the Manchurian Candidate](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0368008/) last night. Much more suspenseful than [the original](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056218/), however lacking [Frank Sinatra](http://www.franksinatra.com/). Maybe it's just my particular political views but the concept of the movie seemed a little closer to home than I would like.
