Tammy and I went to the Prince concert last night at the Xcel Center. I've never seen Prince before and he put on an impressive show. It was non-stop for a little over two hours. The stage and the lighting was very cool and the music was very good as well. Not being a consummate Prince fan, I probably wasn't as "into it" as others at the show were.

We were guests of Trizec which is a property management firm we are considering moving our offices to. The suites at the Xcel Center are _very_ nice. Nicer than even the Target Center.
