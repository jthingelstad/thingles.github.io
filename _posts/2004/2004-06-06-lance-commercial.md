It's prime time for the cycling season right now. Over the course of the last 4 years I've developed a strong interest in professional cycling. I admit, like many it started just as a US Postal and more specifically a Lance thing. But I've really started to love all that there is about cycling from the spring classics to the grand tours.

Anyway, there is a new [Nike commercial with Lance](http://www.nike.com/wearyellow/seelanceride/main.html) that has been shown on [OLN](http://www.olntv.com/) a lot lately. I'm not usually one to comment on commercials, but this thing is really cool.

_Warning: watching this may make you get up and go on a ride if you are a cyclist!_
