I had read rumors over the last couple of days that [Lance Armstrong](http://lancearmstrong.com/) was going to be returning to racing, but there were rumors only and I figured they were very far fetched. Why would the 7-time Tour de France winner return?
Well, it wasn't a rumor! [He is racing in 2009](http://www.livestrong.com/lance2009/)! Wow!

It will be very curious to see what his goal is now. It's hard to imagine that he would attempt for a GC win at the Tour de France, but who knows.
