We just returned from the 2008 Winnipeg Folk Festival. Every year we pick up around 20 albums from performers this year. We've gone entirely digital for our music now so this year I just did it all online after we got home. It's nice to not have to rip everything. We got 19 albums this year, and there are 3 more that I can't find digitally and have mailed the artists to see if I can get. Here are our picks for this year.
