![Fugaise-Restaurant.png](http://thingelstad.com/wp-content/thingelstad/uploads/2008/03/fugaise-restaurant1.png)Tammy and I just got back from a fabulous evening out. We were invited to join our friends across the street, and a number of other folks, at [Fugaise](http://www.fugaise.com/) to celebrate his 40th birthday. It was a wonderful evening and we met some cool new people. However, it was also my first trip to this great Minneapolis restaurant.

If you want to cut to the chase, just stop reading and go there. The food was impeccable. We had a large group so the menus was set with options. I had a great salad with a variety of flavors that just kept you guessing. The main dish was one of the best beef tenderloins I've ever had. The meat was fabulous and prepared perfect. The mashed potatoes had this amazing consistency. It was all followed with a Toffee Bread Pudding with Ice Cream that was stunning with every bite. After the great dinner [Chef Don Saunders](http://www.fugaise.com/about.html) came out and said hi. A very nice touch.

The restaurant was more relaxed than I expected. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but I figured it would be a bit more stuffy. Not at all, jeans welcome, but no t-shirt. The layout of the dining room was cool and the way you enter makes it sort of a reveal.

I highly recommend Fugaise for a special night out, or just any night you want some exceptional food.
