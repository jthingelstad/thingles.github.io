[![200px-Whole_Foods_Market_logo.svg.png](/assets/posts/{{ page.date | date: "%Y" }}/whole-foods-market-logo.png)](http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/)Food culture is always interesting, and now with Mazie I've started to appreciate the food culture of the kid's menu. Here is a shocker: **kids in England don't eat [Macaroni and Cheese](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macaroni_and_cheese)**. Right, amazing, huh? To a guy that grew up in the midwest this is like saying that people in England don't breath air.
Mazie on the other hand requires a regular uptake of Mac-n-Cheese. She's a bit particular about it too. Seh doesn't like the box stuff. She insists on "super cheesey" Mac. She likes the Mac-n-Cheese at [Yum! Kitchen & Bakery](http://www.yumkitchen.com/) a lot but her favorite is probably [Amy's Organic](http://www.amys.com/) Frozen Macaroni and Cheese. It is "super cheesey" and she just scarfs it all down.

_It really is that cheesey._

When we got to London our plan all along was to have breakfast and dinner at the apartment and lunch out. We searched for Mac-n-Cheese and came up really empty handed. We found one option, frozen, at [Tesco](http://www.tesco.com/) and Mazie hated it. She ate one bite and didn't want to touch it again.

Tammy did some research on the Internet and found that Whole Foods may have had the holy grail -- Amy's Organic Frozen Macaroni and Cheese.

_Brits queueing at the oddly designed checkout aisles._

We took the District Line a couple stops up and walked the two blocks to Whole Foods. It was a bit like going to a grocery in Minneapolis. So many options. We struck gold with a good supply of the infamous Macaroni and Cheese and also stocked up on other essentials. I was a bit surprised to find that I couldn't get deli sliced turkey. No turkey sandwiches in the UK either?

Big, huge, parent-minded gratefulness goes out to [Whole Foods in Kensington](http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/UK/kensington/index.html)!
