![delicious-library-2-icon.png]({{ site.url }}{% link /assets/posts/2008/delicious-library-2-icon.png %})Last night [Wil Shipley](http://www.wilshipley.com/blog/), and the Delicious Monster team, released [Delicious Library 2](http://www.delicious-monster.com/). Delicious Library is a cataloging application that I've put to very real use to manage my CD and DVD archive. Since I've moved all of my media onto my network, the physical assets are of no use other than as proof of ownership. I've moved them all into [Slappa](http://www.slappa.com/) cases and to track where things are I use Delicious Library. Yes, a spreadsheet could do it, but it would suck. Delicious Library is such a nice application for this.

Delicious Library 2 [has been anticipated for a long](http://www.slashthing.com/delicious-library-2-interview/) time so it was exciting to get ahold of it. I'm happy to report that with my 1,400+ item library it is much faster. The old Library just stored things in XML, the new one uses CoreData and makes things much faster. Smart Collections are a very welcome addition and remove a needless step from my workflow. I'm also really excited to see additional item types. Software is now trackable and there is a field for serial number so I may move to using this instead of Backpack to keep my software licenses around.

I knew one of the big things coming was web publishing of your library. That's neat, and I've already published [my library](http://library.thingelstad.com/) on the web. You can see it at [**library.thingelstad.com**](http://library.thingelstad.com/). Pretty nifty! There is even a special iPhone view. However, even cooler, you can actually load a published library into another users copy of Delicious Library 2. So, if you have Delicious Library 2, add my library in and you can get native access to it. Very nice!

Publishing lists like this is a long standing tradition with me. My [very first website](http://earlydays.thingelstad.com/) had a [list of my CD's](http://earlydays.thingelstad.com/hobbies/cd-list.html), as well as a [list of Laserdiscs](http://earlydays.thingelstad.com/hobbies/ld-list.html).
