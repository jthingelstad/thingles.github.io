Join us for a time-lapsed view of the 40 minutes of driving from the Oregon/California border on the [US-199](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_199) segment of the [Redwood Highway](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redwood_Highway) as we come into [Crescent City, CA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crescent_City%2C_California). Gorgeous drive with amazing trees. About 3 minutes in we get to the actual Redwood Forest. Buckle up, the time-lapse is 1 frame per second, and it gets a little fast at points.

If you want to see where this segment of the trip was on a map, I've plotted the route Redwood Highway Video Route as a KMZ file that you can open in [Google Earth](http://www.google.com/earth/).
