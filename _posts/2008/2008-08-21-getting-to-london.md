The trick with spending a month in London is that you have to get there, and that has to be done on a plane. Mazie had never been on a plane before and we bullishly pushed through with a trans-atlantic flight as her very first one. Tammy has been on many flights, but has a very real fear of flying causing much stress and anxiety. She was an absolute rock star though keeping all of that to herself and not causing any undue stress for Mazie.

We departed at 9:45 p.m. For whatever reason I felt it absolutely necessary to get to the airport at 6:30 p.m. Having never flown with a kid, and knowing we had 5 bags to check, I figured we needed all the time we could get. In reality, we checked all 5 bags in a few minutes at the curb and flew through security without any issues. With over an hour to spare we decided to have desert at Ike's in the airport. They have a chocolate cake that is a foot tall, rather crazy actually.

The flight itself was fine, but getting Mazie to sleep was not. I had this idea that we would leave at 9:45 p.m. and after the excitement of takeoff ended Mazie would just naturally fall asleep. This was not the case. She didn't go to bed until 1:30 a.m. central time. We tried everything short of medication and nothing would work. I got furious with the screens in the back of every chair that constantly flashed different messages at us, keeping Mazie enthralled with them.

Anyway, she finally got to sleep and I crashed about the same time. Tammy on the other hand spent most of the night [playing Quordy on her iPhone]{% link _posts/2008/2008-08-19-quordy-awesome-game.md %} and got maybe 15 minutes of sleep.

After landing we collected all of our luggage, got through customs, and found a cab for the £55 ride into Kensington. I'm trying to not do [£ to $ conversions]{% link _posts/2008/2008-08-14-go-dollar.md %} here since it's just depressing.

Our first day here was spent mostly recovering from jet lag. We were all crazy tired.
