One of the benefits of visiting London is that we got the chance to visit with our friends [Alice & John](http://sportylondon.blogspot.com/) who moved here a little over a year ago. It's an easy visit too since our apartment is only about four blocks from them. A short walk after Mazie's nap yesterday and we were at their place. It took a while for Mazie and the girls to get in the playing mood with plenty of shyness to go around, but after an hour they were having a lot of fun. Mazie really enjoyed playing with other kids and more than the handful of toys we packed over here. Tammy and I enjoyed catching up with Alice and John and hearing all about their adventures in London. Good times around, finished with good pizza and a couple of pints.

We'll definitely get a couple more visits in before we leave town.
