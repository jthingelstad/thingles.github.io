![summeroflove-header.gif](/assets/posts/{{ page.date | date: "%Y" }}/summeroflove-header1.gif)This summer is going to be filled with a lot of travel. I'm taking the summer off after leaving my current role, before I get going on a new thing. Tammy has given it a name, the **Summer of Love**. We've even got a [wiki](http://wiki.thingelstad.com/SummerOfLove/SummerOfLove) setup to build out our itinerary.
I've been asked by a number of people where we are going on our [West Coast tour](http://wiki.thingelstad.com/SummerOfLove/WestCoast). The cities are listed on the wiki, and you could do a [Google Earth Preview of the Summer of Love](http://thingelstad.com/s/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/summer-of-love.kmz), but how about a video tour!

If you have suggestions of things that we should do in one of those places, [send us a note](http://thingelstad.com/s/contact/img) or [edit the wiki directly](http://wiki.thingelstad.com/SummerOfLove/WestCoast).

The music in the video is Windfall by [Son Volt](http://www.sonvolt.net/). One of my favorite songs, by one of my favorite bands. Notably, it is also the traditional first song to begin a road trip with.
