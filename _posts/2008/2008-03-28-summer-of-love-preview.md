This summer is going to be filled with a lot of travel. I'm taking the summer off after leaving my current role, before I get going on a new thing. Tammy has given it a name, the **Summer of Love**. We've even got a wiki setup to build out our itinerary.

I've been asked by a number of people where we are going on our West Coast tour. The cities are listed on the wiki, and you could do a Google Earth Preview of the Summer of Love, but how about a video tour!

The music in the video is Windfall by [Son Volt](http://www.sonvolt.net/). One of my favorite songs, by one of my favorite bands. Notably, it is also the traditional first song to begin a road trip with.
