Tammy and I are doing final preparation for the second big trip of the Summer of Love. We leave on Sunday for London. We'll be staying there for four weeks and exploring London in detail and taking some day trips as well. We've booked a trip to [Stonehenge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonehenge) and are also planning a day trip to the Royal Observatory to stand on the prime meridian.
We've rented [a flat](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=97+Philbeach+Gardens,+Earls+Court,+London+SW5&sll=44.904888,-93.438689&sspn=0.008891,0.016072&ie=UTF8&z=16&iwloc=addr) for the month. This will be a very different trip than our 6-week tour around the Western US. We'll be staying in one place. We won't have a car and will be using public transport only. I expect to take a lot of pictures and will be trying to post regularly.

Tammy and I will also be taking a short trip to Scotland. My mother is coming over for a couple of weeks. The first week she is spending with us and will be watching Mazie while we are in Scotland. The 2nd week she is honeymooning with her new husband.

There is much planning and packing to do.
