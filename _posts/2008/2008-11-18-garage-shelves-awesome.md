title: Garage Shelves, Awesome

One of the earliest posts on this blog was a celebration of the installation of [6 inch rain gutters on our house](/thingelstad/rain-gutters-installed). By the way, those rain gutters have rocked. It seems only fitting that I should comment on the very small project that we had done in our garage that made me just giddy yesterday.
We had a row of shelves installed on the back wall of our garage. In a period of 6 hours, including moving stuff, having the shelves built, and then putting everything back away the garage was transformed from a disaster scene to a soothing zen experience.

If you come to my house in the next couple of weeks, expect to get a tour of my garage shelves. :-)
