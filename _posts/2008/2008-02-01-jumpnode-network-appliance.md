![appliance.jpg](/assets/posts/{{ page.date | date: "%Y" }}/appliance1.jpg)For the last few months I've had a Jumpnode appliance in my house keeping a tab on all of my computers, the network and other infrastructure. The Jumpnode is an appliance created by a Minneapolis startup that allows people to keep an eye on technology in remote offices, server performance or anything else that you can query via SNMP or WMI. It delivers on it's promise of ease-of-use and exceptionally simple setup.
When you get your Jumpnode you simply unbox it, record the unique serial number and plug it into your network. Everything else is done with a slick Flash application that is hosted by Jumpnode.
