I'm conducting a quick test to see how much interest there would be in hosting a Minneapolis WordCamp. [WordCamp](http://wordcamp.org/) is an [unconference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference) focused on [WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org/) users and developers, including general topics on blogging as well.

I've put a [wiki page up at where you can read more](http://wiki.thingelstad.com/MinneWordCamp) and link to additional information about WordCamps. _If you would like to see an event like this happen, put your name on the [sign up sheet](http://wiki.thingelstad.com/MinneWordCamp/SignUpSheet)!_

Please help spread the word and tell your friends that may be interested in this event about it too!
