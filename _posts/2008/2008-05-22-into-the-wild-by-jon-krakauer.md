[![Into-The-Wild-Cover.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/posts/2008/into-the-wild-cover.png)](http://www.amazon.com/Into-Wild-Jon-Krakauer/dp/0385486804)I finished _[Into the Wild](http://www.amazon.com/Into-Wild-Jon-Krakauer/dp/0385486804)_ by _[Jon Krakauer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Krakauer)_ this evening. It was enjoyable to both start and finish this book during our stay at Glacier National Park. Reading that much is just one of the joys of not having any television or Internet access in our cabin. I was excited to read this book after having watched the movie version of _Into the Wild_. My friend [Kent](http://www.thetangens.net/) lent me his copy of the book and it's already been passed on to Tammy to read before returning to Kent.
First off, this is a really enjoyable book and just like the other Krakauer book I've read, _Into Thin Air_, this is a real page turner. Even a slow reader like myself can't help but finish it quickly, picking it up at every opportunity to see what happens next.

For a full review of the book or to dive into it's topics, check out the Amazon reviews or just read it yourself. I think most people will enjoy it.

The whole story of [Chris McCandless](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_McCandless), aka Alexander Supertramp, really grabbed me. Kent and I talked about this at some length because he had the same reaction. His story is beyond interesting, and I find it impossible to think about his story without also reflecting on my own life. I think that there is something about the ferocity that Alex lived and dreamt that makes me, something.

That's the thing about Alex's story. On one hand, he's incredibly selfish. His entire pursuit is so inwardly focused and causes a lot of pain for most anyone that got close to him. He goes completely off the deep end, and in the end loses his life foolishly. With some basic preparation and know how he probably would have survived his ordeal in the Alaskan Interior and nobody would have ever heard of Alexander Supertramp.

But even with those negatives, you feel a sense of admiration for the young man. A sense of pride. Or even a sense of shame for not having the courage or discipline to pursue something the way that he did, or even a fraction of the way that he did.

Have any of you read this book? I would be curious to know what you thought of it and what your reaction was. I think that Chris' story is going to sit with me for a while.
