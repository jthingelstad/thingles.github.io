![]({{ site.url }}/assets/posts/2008/wordpresslogo.thumbnail.jpg.jpg?format=original)I just upgraded [WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org/) to 2.3.2 on all of the sites I run. Of course this starts with the mandatory upgrade of any plugins that are outdated. While WordPress has made this much easier with automatic version checking, it's still far too much of a pain.
Comment here if something appears broken.
