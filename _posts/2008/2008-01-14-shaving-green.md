![istock-000003841554xsmall.png](/assets/posts/2008/istock-000003841554xsmall1.png)Our house keeps getting greener and greener. Tammy has done an awesome job of finding alternative products for us to use that are better for the planet and us. This process started in the kitchen and has slowly spread, now reaching the bathroom.
Green products and the bathroom are a struggle. We've all gotten so used to the various products that we have available that switching is challenging. Natural soaps are easy. Even natural toothpaste is a breeze. [Tom's of Maine](http://www.tomsofmaine.com/) toothpaste is great, and after using it for a while you will think regular toothpaste is overly sweet and nasty.

Shaving however was filled with canned gels in nasty packaging with nasty ingredients made in nasty processes, not to mention huge marketing budgets. Tammy pushed me to get off of those things and switch and I eagerly jumped in. There are only two options at the co-op for shaving and luckily the 2nd one is great.

![AlbaShave.jpg](/assets/posts/2008/albashave1.jpg)[Alba Botanical](http://www.albabotanica.com/) makes this [shave cream](http://www.albabotanica.com/?id=65&pid=113) that works like a charm. It is actually one of those great examples of a green product that you prefer over the previous product after you get used to it (like the [toothpaste](http://www.tomsofmaine.com/toms/product.asp?dept%255Fid=450&pf%255Fid=TP%252DFL)). It's not all foamy so you don't get to see big lines of white foam come off of your face as you shave (note photo for this post). You have to keep track on your own where you left off. It's incredibly smooth and I find much more refreshing than the other gels and foams I've used over the years. It also defies our American approach of some being good, so a lot must be better. You apply this stuff sparsely and it's great. If you slather it all over, it doesn't work as well.

As a bonus, it's just a lotion so you can easily put some in a small container and take it on a plane without the need for special packaging. I know some guys that actually just shave with handsoap now to avoid taking shaving cream containers on planes. You should really consider some of this lotion instead.

Go ahead and start greening up your bathroom with your morning shave.
