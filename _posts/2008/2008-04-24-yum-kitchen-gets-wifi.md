![]({{ site.url }}/assets/posts/2008/yum-kitchen-logo.gif)The Internet continues to expand! I was recently at [Yum! Kitchen and Bakery](http://www.yumkitchen.com/), a [regular favorite restaurant](/thingelstad/yum-kitchen-and-bakery) of ours, and was happy to see [my iPhone](/thingelstad/i-got-my-iphone) detect a new open wireless network named "Yum".
You can now happily nosh on some great food, coffee and treats while surfing the Internet in style.
