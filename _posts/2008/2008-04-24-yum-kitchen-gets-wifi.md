![]({{ site.url }}{% link /assets/posts/2008/yum-kitchen-logo.gif %})The Internet continues to expand! I was recently at [Yum! Kitchen and Bakery](http://www.yumkitchen.com/), a [regular favorite restaurant]({{site.url}}{% link _posts/2006/2006-01-22-yum-kitchen-and-bakery.md %}) of ours, and was happy to see [my iPhone]({{site.url}}{% link _posts/2007/2007-07-01-i-got-my-iphone.md %}) detect a new open wireless network named "Yum".

You can now happily nosh on some great food, coffee and treats while surfing the Internet in style.
