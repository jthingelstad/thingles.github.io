I got out and placed [ballot #382](http://twitter.com/thingles/status/989382824) this morning around 8:30 am. Contrary to what I've heard in many precincts there was almost no line and I was able to walk in and out in about 10 minutes. I talked to my mother who said it took her about an hour and she had to stand in lines over a hundred people long. There was a [longer line in 2006](/thingelstad/37), but I also voted right at poll opening that day with ballot #37.
