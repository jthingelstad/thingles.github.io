![Edward-Tufte.jpg]({{ site.url }}{% link /assets/posts/2008/edward-tufte1.jpg %})I was checking out [Edward Tufte's site](http://www.edwardtufte.com/) the other day and I noted that he is going to be returning to Minneapolis again for [his seminar](http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/courses). [I've been to his seminar]({{site.url}}{% link _posts/2005/2005-04-26-edward-tufte.md %}) twice and would consider going a third time but I'll be out of town.

If you haven't been to his seminar before I really recommend it. It's like taking a bath in high quality analysis of visual displays. Even if your day job doesn't directly involve designing it is still a very worthwhile and educational way to spend a day. Plus you get copies of all four of his books.
