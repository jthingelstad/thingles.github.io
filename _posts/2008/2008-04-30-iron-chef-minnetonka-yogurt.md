A couple of years ago we had a fun evening at the [Bernard's](http://www.jimbernard.net/) house where our friend Dean Eichaker and I did a mock [Iron Chef](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Chef) competition. The secret ingredient was tomatoes. I'd like to think I won, but the evening ended in more wine than judging and we all just enjoyed some great food. Tammy has taken this idea and decided to run with it and make it real! In January we had our first professional-mock Iron Chef competition and Dean and I faced off again, over **yogurt**!
Tammy did this video. It's fun, but I'll warn you it is approximately 15 minutes long. So sit back and enjoy!

We just finished the 2nd Iron Chef where this video was shown. There will be more episodes coming!
