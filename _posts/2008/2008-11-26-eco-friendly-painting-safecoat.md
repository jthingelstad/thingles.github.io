[![head_logo.jpg]({{ site.url }}/assets/posts/2008/head-logo.jpg)](http://www.afmsafecoat.com/)Tammy has wanted to change some colors in our house for a while. If you've been to our place you know we are not afraid of color in any way. Our living room is orange, yellow and red.
There are a couple of rooms that she wanted to change and keeping with the green theme she searched hard to find a No VOC paint option that would work. What is VOC? [Volatile Organic Compounds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatile_organic_compound). I really don't know much about this world, but as I understand from her the fumes from VOC's in paint are really bad for you. And it's not just the fumes from when you are painting, those chemicals continue to be present for a while and leech into the [air in your house](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sick_building_syndrome).

After much searching she found [Safecoat](). Safecoat is a No VOC paint, but it goes even further and contains nothing _bad_. You see, some No VOC paint is only that by label, in that it contains some chemicals that are not good for you but aren't labeled as a VOC so they can still have the label. Safecoat is pristine in it's health and eco credentials.

Over the last _three days_ the kitchen has received new paint on the walls and ceiling. Using the Safecoat product was an eye-opener. We didn't have any windows open while the painting was going on, and there was absolutely **no smell** in the house. If you didn't see the paint, there is no way you would know painting was going on. It was really amazing.

If you're going to do some painting do yourself and your family a favor and use Safecoat. In the Minneapolis area head over to [Natural Built Home](http://www.naturalbuilthome.com/) to get it.
