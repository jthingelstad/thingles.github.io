Yesterday we had a birthday party for Mazie. Her actual birthday is a few weeks away and we'll be in Las Vegas on the Summer of Love trip at that time. So, we had this one so she could celebrate with the family. She had a great time and really got into the birthday celebration. She also likes to make up words. Here she is having a great time doing just that for the camera, and Uncle Max joins in the fun as well.

She had just eaten all the frosting off of her cake. :-)
