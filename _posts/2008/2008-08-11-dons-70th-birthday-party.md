This past weekend Tammy and her sisters Corinne, [Angie](http://www.lundeenscene.blogspot.com/) and [Michelle](http://hmfernandez.com/) threw a surprise birthday party for their Dad, Don Olson.

It was a very nice party and Don was totally surprised. Denny and Corinne made some awesome food and about 70 people were there. My job for the event was to get a video together. We did interview scenes with all the girls and mom, along with a bunch of pictures.

Of course if you get people in front of a camera you get some silly moments. I had enough to remix it back into this outtake video.

Angie put a [post on her brand new blog about it](http://lundeenscene.blogspot.com/2008/08/surprise-don-is-70.html). This morning I whipped up a quick video from the birthday party itself but I've reached my upload limit on [Vimeo](http://www.vimeo.com/)! Ugh! In the next few days when my quota is reset I'll put it up.
