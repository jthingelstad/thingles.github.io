For those of you tracking my progress on my weight loss journey here is an update. Since my [last check-in]({{site.url}}{% link _posts/2008/2008-10-10-weight-loss-check-in-for-oct-10-2008.md %}) I have had a lot of great progress. At my last check-in I was at 314.6 and today I'm at **307.4**, losing **7.2** pounds in those two weeks with a total loss of **14.8** pounds. Most of that weight came off in the last week with some intentionally focused high-quality food work.

I've continued my program without any changes and I'm feeling really good. If anything, I was a lot _less_ hungry in the last week which isn't surprising. I'm currently on track to hit my first goal of being sub-300 by the end of the year, and am actually a bit ahead.
