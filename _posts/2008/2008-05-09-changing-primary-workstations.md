As I get ready to leave Dow Jones I've been working to get my home office setup more streamlined for work. I think I've succeeded, and am in store for a big upgrade actually! Here is my current workstation at the office, where I spend most of my computer time.

And this is what I'll be using at home.

Yeah, that will work. :-)
