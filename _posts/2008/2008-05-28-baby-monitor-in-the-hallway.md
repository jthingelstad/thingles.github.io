Tammy and I are [hanging out](/thingelstad/rhythm-of-travel) in this extremely cool, funky hotel in Portland called [McMenamins Kennedy School](http://www.kennedyschool.com/index.php?loc=57). It used to be a school, but they converted it to a hotel, restaurant and bar. It's very cool.
Anyway, Mazie is asleep and the monitor doesn't quiet reach to us. We have it sitting in the hallway about 30 feet from us where we can see the lights if she started hollering for us.

The funny thing is watching people walk by. People keep looking at it. Picking it up. Listening. Etc. It's a pretty funny social experiment. It makes me think it would be pretty funny to actually broadcast something over it and put it in the hall. Maybe the original [War of the Worlds](http://www.mercurytheatre.info/) or an early episode of [The Shadow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shadow_%28fictional_character%29). Hmmm...
