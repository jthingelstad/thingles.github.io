I've hesitated and resisted migrating all my native Canon Raw (CRW and CR2) files to DNG. However, over the last couple of months I started to do a DNG conversion on import. Today I went all in.

I'm doing a mass conversion year-by-year. I'll write another post on the process and how much space I saved, and a little of why I did it.

For those of you I've told for years to **not** use DNG, forget all that. :-)
