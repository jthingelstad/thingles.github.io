This is the end of the second week since I took a [hard diet change and got serious](/thingelstad/too-fat-losing-weight) about getting myself back into something resembling fitness. My initial progress has been great. This week (Friday to Friday) I lost a little 4.4 pounds with a total weight loss of 7.8 pounds. This is what it looks like.

The green line shows my goal trajectory. That line tracks back to 300 by the New Year and I'm keeping close to it. The red line is a smoothed view of my weight and it was going up for a while just as an anomaly of me loading years of old data into it. Now that I have some recent data it is reflecting reality.

I've been journaling my food (not logging it). So I'm writing stuff down but not counting calories or points or anything. I've got goals for each meal and I'm hitting them well. In fact, I'm not even feeling all that hungry which is great.

I am feeling strong, a bit quicker and am really positive. Off to a great start!
