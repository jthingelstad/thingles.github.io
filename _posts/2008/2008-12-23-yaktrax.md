![yaktrax.png](/assets/posts/{{ page.date | date: "%Y" }}/yaktrax.png)I've been taking the dogs out on walks every morning, provided the temperature is about 0Â°. Now that we've had a bunch of snow I've found the morning to be a bit slippery, especially on the one hill. And the fresh snow doesn't give much traction. Feels a lot like walking in sand.
I was reading [Robert Craig](http://fnirt.blogspot.com/)'s blog and saw his [post about his YakTrax](http://fnirt.blogspot.com/2008/12/robert-1-weather-0.html) and how well they worked. This seemed like a great addition to my morning activities. Santa Claus visited our house early last night (we are traveling this Christmas) and left some YakTrax for me, as well as winter gear for the dogs.

The [YakTrax](http://www.yaktrax.com/) are easy to get on. They slip on the bottom of your shoe without much hassle. I have the [YakTrax Walkers](http://www.yaktrax.com/ProductsWalker.aspx). The dogs and I went out for an hour today and the YakTrax made a huge difference. I didn't slip at all, and had as much traction for walking as I'd ever want to have.

Tammy said that some people online were complaining that they had broken on them, sometimes on the first use. I've only wore them once so I can't speak to how well they will last. I can see how if you put them on wrong, or had one of the bands crimped badly, it could cause a problem. We'll see.

In the meantime, if you walk reasonable distances in the snow, I'd highly recommend [buying a pair of YakTrax](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0002ZA72O/?tag=thingelstad-20).
