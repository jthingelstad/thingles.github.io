[![logo_lafitness.gif]({{ site.url }}{% link /assets/posts/2008/logo-lafitness.gif %})](http://www.lafitness.com/)Tammy and I have had a gym membership for a while. Let's just be nice and say that the membership was "under-leveraged". We got pretty excited around a year ago when some construction started fairly close to our house and we found out it was going to be a new [LA Fitness](http://www.lafitness.com/) location. The location is much closer to our house than our previous options, and we knew that LA Fitness was cheaper as well.

This weekend we stopped in and took a tour. We were pretty impressed. They don't attempt to have a "spa experience". There is no water wall in the entry way. In fact, there isn't even a towel service. But, the equipment is really great and the space is nice. Not too tight; not too distracting.

We signed up right away cutting time and distance to get the gym by 70%, and cutting our monthly fee by 70%. Win, win! We are both looking forward to getting some good use out of the membership.
