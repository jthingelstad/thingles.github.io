One of the things that makes the Mac so great is the wonderful independent, or "indy", software developers out there. Mac software is typically not just functional, but beautiful. I recently bought Timeline 3D from [Bee Docs'](http://www.beedocuments.com/) and got this great postcard from the author.

Not only beautiful and functional software, but great customer interaction.
