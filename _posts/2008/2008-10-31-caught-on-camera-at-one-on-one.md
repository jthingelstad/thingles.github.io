[![Star-Tribune-One-on-One-Article-Thumbnail.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/posts/2008/star-tribune-one-on-one-article-thumbnail.png)]({{ site.url }}/assets/posts/2008/star-tribune-one-on-one-article.png)When I worked downtown I was really lucky to have this very cool independent coffee shop just a block away from the office. I made a daily trip, even in the freezing cold of January, to get a coffee from [One on One](http://www.oneononebike.com/). Now that I'm not downtown all the time I don't get there as often, but it seems I did make it into the background on a recent photo shoot!
I was there a couple of weeks ago and I remember them moving some bikes around and it seemed a bit goofy. I saw a photographer and just figured they were doing some promotional shots for the website or something. Turns out it was actually for [an article in the Star Tribune](http://www.startribune.com/business/33478314.html) and I snuck into the background. See the top-left corner.

If you are in the area and like coffee, bikes or both stop by. I highly [recommend the cold press coffee](/thingelstad/cold-press-coffee), this is where I was turned on to the wonders of that stuff.

By the way, the [Robin Williams](http://www.robinwilliams.com/) visit mentioned in that article was captured in person at the end of [my Farewell video](/thingelstad/farewell-video) by my buddies [Jim](http://www.jimbernard.net/) and [Kent](http://www.thetangens.net/).

_Thanks to Eric Marshall for tipping me off to this!_
