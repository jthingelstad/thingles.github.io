I dropped [our Honda Odyssey]({{site.url}}{% link _posts/2005/2005-09-24-honda-odyssey.md %}) off this morning for regular maintenance at [Richfield Honda](http://rbhonda.com/). I was pretty impressed to see this sign on the door.

That's a nice touch. Getting a call mid-day from the service department can be little annoying and a simple text message is a great alternative. Well done and a great example of going where you customers are.
