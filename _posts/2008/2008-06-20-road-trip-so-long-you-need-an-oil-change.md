![oil-change-small.jpeg]({{ site.url }}{% link /assets/posts/2008/oil-change-small.jpeg %})Yesterday we passed a milestone on the Summer of Love. After [29 days on the road](/thingelstad/summer-of-love-index-updated) and [driving 4,541 miles](/thingelstad/summer-of-love-index-updated) the Honda Odyssey kindly let us know that it was due for an oil change.
Before we left on our trip my friend [Kent](http://www.thetangens.net/) had the revelation that our trip was so long that even with a fresh oil change, which we had done, we would need to have an oil change on the way. This, rightfully so, justified in his mind an entirely new level of road trip. One that exceeds all relevant norms. In fact, after learning of our oil change he reclassified the Summer of Love as an ["epic" trip](http://twitter.com/ktangen/statuses/839103901).

There isn't that much in Sedona, so on our way back from the [Grand Canyon](http://www.nps.gov/grca/) yesterday we stopped in Flagstaff to run a number of errands -- including getting the oil changed at [Flagstaff Honda](http://www.flagstaffmotors.com/).
