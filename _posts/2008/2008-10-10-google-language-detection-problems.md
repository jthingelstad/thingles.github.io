When I was traveling in the UK I had a couple of really interesting experiences using the normal set of online services I use. The Internet really doesn't have a concept of countries, but I found myself unable to do some things while I was there because various online services made assumptions by mapping my IP address to a country. This is a process called [geo targeting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geo_targeting) and it is used in online advertising almost always. My experience highlighted that you should be careful to use it for account settings or commerce transactions.
For example, when I was in parts of the UK and tried to login to Google Reader I was greeted with this screen.

I'm not sure what language that is, but it isn't one I know. Now, while it wasn't english it was obvious to me, and I think to most people, that you should just login in the form provided. I figured once I logged in it would then know via my preferences where I live and flip the language back to english. Unfortunately, it wasn't so smart.

Another example of this problem popped up when I was trying to renew my Google Earth subscription. Unfortunately I wasn't even able to do it since it would only allow me to see the UK store and only allow me to buy the one in Â£'s even though my account is entirely setup in the US.

Good food for thought on how far you should take geo targeting in building out products, versus marketing.
