I [wrote earlier about FriendFeed]({{ site.url }}{% link _posts/2008/2008-03-18-friendfeed-is-pretty-cool.md %}) and I'm continuing to really enjoy it. I've played in the past with aggregation and this is by far the best solution for "life streaming" out there yet. Here is the perfect example of why [FriendFeed](http://friendfeed.com/) is cool.

The [Twitter](http://twitter.com/thingles/statuses/777069379) and Flickr actions tied together; open and mashable in a "Web 2.0" way. Very cool.
