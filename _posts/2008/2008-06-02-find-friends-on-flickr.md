[![flickrfriends-logo.png](/assets/posts/2008/flickrfriends-logo.png)](http://flickrfriends.tinnedfruit.com/)I find myself really liking [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/) more and more. I'm really pleased with the features and how usable, and very importantly, how extendable it is. You can find [me on Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jthingelstad/).
However, one area where Flickr falls really short is finding your friends. Sure, if you have a GMail or Yahoo! Mail account you can find people via that, but what about everyone else? Enter Flickr Friends!

[Flickr Friends](http://flickrfriends.tinnedfruit.com/) is a great little site that will take an address book export (including a vCard dump from Leopard's Address Book) and find anyone in your address book that has a Flickr account. It's great stuff and I was able to connect with a bunch of friends right away.
