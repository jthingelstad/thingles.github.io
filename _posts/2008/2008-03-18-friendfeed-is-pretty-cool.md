[![friendfeed-logo.png]({{ site.url }}{% link /assets/posts/2008/friendfeed-logo1.png %})](http://friendfeed.com/)In September 2007 I came up with the idea of using a Yahoo! [Pipe](http://pipes.yahoo.com/) to create the [Thingelstad Superfeed](http://thingelstad.com/s/2007/09/thingelstad-superfeed/img). The basic idea was to provide one feed that you could get all my "stuff" with. It seems it was a good idea, since a couple of companies are now doing exactly this. I setup a [profile on FriendFeed](http://friendfeed.com/thingles) to play with and I have to admit that I was more impressed than I expected.

FriendFeed replicates a lot of social networking concepts, but to use it as a basic way to consolidate information on friends it works really well. It makes adding additional feeds really simple, and has built in hooks to many of the most popular websites out there.Check it out, you may find it pretty cool, and feel free to add me as a friend.
