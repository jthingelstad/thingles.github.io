**This is frustrating.**
I've spent the last couple of hours trying to find a new [WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org/) theme for Tammy's blog, Smaller Than a Redwood. This is so frustrating.

First, she can't do it herself easily because the look of a theme is completely unpredictable of its functionality. I would argue that a theme that doesn't support sidebar widgets and tags right out of the box, should just be deleted. Why do we still have this junk floating around the Internet?

Worse still is the volume of themes that are just purely broken. We found a theme and I started to "fix" it, meaning add tagging support, and then found out several of the themes own images were not in the download and cannot be found on the Internet.

Argh! Now, back to Google to try to sift through thousands of piles of crap and see if I can find a workable theme.
