[Minnebar](http://www.minnebar.org/) is approaching this weekend, May 10th! I'm really excited and I just couldn't stand to not be presenting this year so I decided to put my name up and do a session on [Power WordPress](http://barcamp.pbwiki.com/MinneBarSessions#PowerWordPress) usage. I plan to hit on must-have plugins that can save you a ton of time as well as some great SEO tactics for driving more traffic to your site. It should be a lot of fun!

I also hope to get some feedback and talk a bit about doing a WordCamp in the fall.
