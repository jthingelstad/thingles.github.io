This year marks something that will not happen again until [2014](http://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/monthly.html?month=6&year=2014&country=1), when Mazie turns 9. Father's Day is the day right after [Mazie's birthday]({{site.url}}{% link _posts/2008/2008-06-14-daddys-girl-turns-three.md %})! [Father's Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father's_Day) is always the 3rd Sunday in June. After 2014 it won't happen again until [2025](http://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/monthly.html?month=6&year=2025&country=1), on Mazie's 20th birthday. Now, I know what you are all wondering. When will Mazie's birthday be on Father's day? Never. It gets to the day before, and then flips back away because Father's Day moves back due the third Sunday thing.
I love being a Dad and as the years pass I realize more and more that it's the most important thing in my life. [Your job changes]({{site.url}}{% link _posts/2008/2008-05-09-marketwatch-dow-jones-chapter-closing.md %}), your hobbies come and go. Your family is always your family. Your kids are forever your kids. Taking this summer off has provided a luxury that I'm so lucky to have. To be able to spend all my time with my family. Completely unrelated, I was [reading The Soul of a New Machine]({{site.url}}{% link _posts/2008/2008-06-15-the-soul-of-a-new-machine-by-tracy-kidder.md %}) today and this passage seemed so fitting for the day (p. 279).

<blockquote>During that summer, West suddenly remembered bike rides he'd taken with his father on Sunday evenings, and he found time to reassert that tradition with his oldest daughter. Suddenly, it seemed, he realized that his children were growing, and apparently he intended now to guide them on their way. He said one evening: "That's the bear trap, the greatest vice. Your job. You can justify about any behavior with it. Maybe that's why you do it, so you don't have to deal with all those other problems."
> 
> </blockquote>

I like to think that I've kept my priorities in order, but I think the "bear trap" reference is appropriate. Its good to remind myself what is important and where priorities lie. I'm grateful to have this summer for that, and to have Father's Day every year to reflect on it.
