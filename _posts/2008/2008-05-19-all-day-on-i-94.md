Today we loaded up in the Honda Odyssey and started our big trip. Packing was a bit last minute, we weren't really done until just shortly before leaving. It was a pretty busy weekend.

[![70px-I-94.svg.png]({{ site.url }}{% link /assets/posts/2008/70px-i-94svg.png %})](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_94)Today was spent entirely in the van except for two quick stops for food. We went about 15 miles from our house and got on [I-94](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_94) and didn't let it leave our site the whole day ([Google Earth view](http://thingelstad.com/s/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/may-19.kmz)). Mazie did a great job all things considering. We fired up a bunch of different music on the [new iPod Classic](http://www.slashthing.com/new-ipod-classic-160g/) that we got for the trip. Mazie enjoyed a full watching of [Charlotte's Web](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070016/) as well. Tunes for the day included [Son Volt](http://www.sonvolt.net/), [Willie Nelson](http://www.willienelson.com/) and Frank Sinatra among others.
