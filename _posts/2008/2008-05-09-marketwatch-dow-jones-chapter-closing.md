Today I'm closing a very long chapter in my career. This is my last day at [Dow Jones](http://www.dowjones.com/)/[MarketWatch](http://www.marketwatch.com/). This transition has been in the works for a while. It was announced in January and over the course of the following months I've been able to wrap-up some projects, transition others and most importantly work to get my replacement hired and up-to-speed. I'm happy to leave on a Friday, and have a new CTO start on Monday to take the organization forward. My replacement will be in New York which I think will be immensely helpful. I've been able to do a lot from Minneapolis, but moving to New York isn't in the cards and it was time for me to do something different.
The past 10+ years have been amazing. This chart is a great representation of all the twists and turns that have occurred over that period.

This is a tough day. It's filled with a lot of emotion. I've found myself reflecting a lot over this week. Remembering a lot of past colleagues, all the great projects and even some of the bombs. It's been amazing to see an organization grow and change through so many events. I'm incredibly proud of everything that has been accomplished by such this great team.

I'll be taking a respite this summer and enjoying a great number of trips with my family. Stay tuned right here for news on those travels!
