[![Tammy and Mazie at Apartment](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3140/2780710881_62bfb8af39_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/46408384@N00/2780710881)Our London trip is a lot different from our Summer of Love West Coast Road Tour. Notably, we aren't on the road very much for London and with the exception of a short jaunt to Scotland for Tammy and I, we are staying put in London proper.

We rented an apartment for the month and have gotten settled in. We are in the Kensington area at Philbeach Gardens. The apartment is good. We have about 800 square feet and behind the apartment is a very large private courtyard where Mazie can play. I think the nicest thing about the apartment is the dining room with a glass ceiling. I've setup my computer in this area with great light.

On the downside we are missing some niceties. Mainly what was advertised as included Internet access is really a 3G HSDPA Modem ([Huawei E220](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huawei_E220)). It's better than nothing, but you have to tip toe around the Internet and wait for long delays. We have a washing machine but no dryer, I guess we just hang our clothes to dry.

We went shopping for some supplies at a [nearby](http://www.qype.co.uk/place/63913-Tesco-Stores-London) [Tesco](http://www.tesco.com/). It took us over an hour to find what we were looking for. It's great that London is English, but there is no doubt you are in a foreign country. It took us about 10 minutes to find baking soda.

I put a [set of photos of the apartment](http://flickr.com/photos/jthingelstad/sets/72157606854297279/) online for a little virtual tour.
