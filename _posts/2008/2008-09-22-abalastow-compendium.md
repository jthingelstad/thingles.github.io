![Abalastow-Compendium-Detail.png](/assets/posts/2008/abalastow-compendium-detail.png)My buddy [Dan](http://www.unpossible.com/) has [issued an SEO challenge](http://www.unpossible.com/2008/09/22/abalastow-compendium/) to the students in his class. I thought it was pretty cool and could use some spice to see how base [PageRank](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank) affects search rankings. I'm curious to see where I would fit in, so I put this post out there.
[Google](http://www.google.com/), come and get it.

I see the [search results](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=Abalastow+Compendium&btnG=Search) already have a [hit from blog.lib.umn.edu](http://blog.lib.umn.edu/pemb0031/abalastowcompendium/). That is going to be tough since Google loves .edu and .org so much more than .com, but we'll see.

No [Wikipedia hits for Abalastow Compendium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=Abalastow+Compendium&go=Go) either.

_The image at the right is what I imagine an antique Abalastow Compendium to look like._

_**Update (9/25/08):**__ Proving some theory of the Internetâ„¢ or human behavior true some enterprising individuals have actually put a trump card and bought the Abalastow Compendium domain name, both the [.com](http://www.abalastow-compendium.com/) and even the [.org](http://www.abalastow-compendium.org/) version. Nobody grabbed .net it seems._
