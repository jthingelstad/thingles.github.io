I've posted before about the [immense problems with bottled water]({{site.url}}{% link _posts/2007/2007-09-11-stop-drinking-bottled-water.md %}). Tammy and I have been on a massive push to push all non-necessary plastic out of our lives banning bottled water was one of the first ones we did.

I was browsing the web the other day and ran across a campaign where you can sign up to [Break the Bottled Water Habit](http://water.newdream.org/campaigns/water/register/6427ef56fb09c0bed80f8caa291482c9/).

Tammy and I had our first real test of this commitment when we went on the road for 6 weeks this summer. It was really tempting to get bottled water and in fact I broke down twice and did get two bottles of water during the entire trip. Tammy was pristine and drank nothing other than tap water transported in her trusty Sigg bottle.

C'mon, drop the plastic and turn on the tap!
