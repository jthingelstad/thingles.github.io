Tammy just hosted/produced the most recent Iron Chef Minnetonka night. This time around was a very special theme. You'll have to wait 3 months though to see the video from it. In the meantime, enjoy the just released video from the last Iron Chef Minnetonka -- Egg edition! Tammy did this video and its great!
