I've known about flow and experienced flow all of my life. I think I started to really understand it when I started programming in my early teens. I had no idea what it was called, but I definitely understood the absence of time, the stream of thought that just worked and the clarity of presence that accompanied it all.
[Kathy Sierra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathy_Sierra) ([her blog](http://headrush.typepad.com/) is suspended, but she is [active on Twitter](http://twitter.com/KathySierra)) talked a lot about the power of flow, and notably how so much on our computers and the Internet is a "[flow killer](http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2006/12/httpwww37signal.html)" (i.e., [Twitter](http://twitter.com/)).

I was watching some recent video segments from [TED](http://www.ted.com/) and was excited to see flow on the agenda. This is a good talk about flow by [Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi).




Csikszentmihalyi is "the man" on flow, and has a book on the topic called [Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0060920432/?tag={{ site.affiliate.amazon }}). I may need to read that.
