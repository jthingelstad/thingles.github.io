Sometimes I get stuck on something, particularly late at night and I get totally obsessed. It's almost always not very important, but then I obsess about it and the only thing that pushes me away to sleep is the dead battery of my laptop. The other night I got totally obsessed with taking a different tact on my OS X desktop. Clean. Simple.

This is the look. I'm really liking it. I went with an abstract desktop for focus and really minimized what I had in the dock. Instead, I'm using a lot of the fancy Leopard folder tricks to launch things. Front and center in this is [CoverSutra](http://www.coversutra.com/) for the tangible side of digital music and [WeatherDock](http://www.alwintroost.nl/?id=9) to keep me in the loop with the temperature. [Quicksilver](http://docs.blacktree.com/quicksilver/what_is_quicksilver) rounds out the stack to tie it all together. Also, [Warp](http://www.ksuther.com/warp/) is a must have extension to make Leopard's [Spaces](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/spaces.html) more usable. The Shared Desktop folder on my desktop is synchronized on every computer I use with the application that I can't seem to kick, [FolderShare](https://www.foldershare.com/). [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/) bought FolderShare forever ago and it's still a PowerPC binary but it works like magic. I wish there was a better Mac-centric, OS X Intel option. Oh well..

I feel so calm. :-)
