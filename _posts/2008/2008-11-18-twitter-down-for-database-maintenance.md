Lately Twitter has actually been reasonably reliable, at least compared to it's previous daily (hourly?) issues. But can this really be right? I pulled up the page at 10:22 am CT and apparently they are down for database maintenance? First off, you should be able to do maintenance without going down. Secondly, why on earth would you do this during the day when you are swamped with traffic?
