I've been working with financial news for years now and there is a really common problem in financial news, [deduplication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deduplication). The issue is when several news outlets will cover the same story or even redistribute another sources story, creating duplicates that readers find annoying. As the web becomes more mashable, I saw the first sign of this same problem on [FriendFeed](http://friendfeed.com/) today.
[One of the people I follow](http://friendfeed.com/loupaglia) had both [Twitter](http://twitter.com/loupaglia) and [Tumblr](http://loupaglia.tumblr.com/) feeding into his FriendFeed. But, he also had Twitter feeding Tumblr. In flowed the dups!

He removed the Twitter to Tumblr feed to stop this, but it was a glimpse of a feature that FriendFeed is going to need to consider. In this instance, deduplication would be pretty easy since the content is exactly the same.
