Lately Mazie has really been into letters and trying to figure out what letter a word starts with. For example, she's figured out that "Mazie starts with an M", "Apple starts with an A", etc.
Today she declared that "eyebrow starts with an I". Tammy explained to her that while eyebrow does sound like an i, it is really an e, and that sometimes words are a little tricky. I suggested that if Apple were to describe eyebrows they may in fact start with an i.
