A few weeks ago I got the opportunity to do a phone interview with [Scott Swigart](http://howsoftwareisbuilt.com/about-scott-swigart/) and [Sean Campbell](http://howsoftwareisbuilt.com/about-sean-campbell/) who are doing a series of interviews regarding [How Software Is Built](http://howsoftwareisbuilt.com/). [The interview](http://howsoftwareisbuilt.com/2008/04/02/interview-with-jamie-thingelstad-cto-wall-street-journal-digital-network/) was a lot of fun and really hit around the general theme of how open source is changing the way software is created.

It is long, but I think it came out pretty well.
