This election year is the first with a very well established social networking world. I thought this real-time counter that [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/) put up today was really cool.

You can watch the number go up and up in as people report in. This was a screen shot at 9:44 am central time.

I love this trend. Socially we know that people tend to act in groups and if they see a million other people on Facebook have voted it will encourage people who might not take the time to vote, to get out there and do it.
