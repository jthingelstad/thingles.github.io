A couple of weeks ago Canon made a really big splash by announcing the [Canon 5D Mark II](http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&fcategoryid=139&modelid=17662). I'm a [longtime Canon owner](http://thingelstad.com/s/hobbies/photography/img) now having gone from the Digital Rebel to 20D to 40D now. I've wanted a 5D ever since the first one came out since it has no focal length multiplier. The CMOS sensor is the same size as a 35mm negative and since I love to shoot wide and have some great lenses for it, getting rid of the multiplier is a huge win to me. What I wasn't expecting is that the 5D Mark II would come onto the scene with full HD quality video capture.
It's best to just see what this camera can do. Full 1080p at 30 fps using all of your amazing Canon glass (lenses) opens up some amazing opportunities. [Vincent Laforet](http://blog.vincentlaforet.com/) put together [this video for Canon](http://vincentlaforet.smugmug.com/gallery/6042742_wZKiA#377930419_dgxvY-A-LB) created entirely on the new 5D Mark II. It's amazing.

Obviously Laforet has more talent in his little finger than I could hope to have, this is a great video. But look at the technical quality of it and the shots achieved with depth-of-field and a simple fisheye lens. This really opens the door to some amazing options, and simply isn't possible even on "prosumer" HD video cameras.

By the way, this is the video that I was [complaining about Canon not being able to host](/thingelstad/canon-exceeded-download-capacity) before.
