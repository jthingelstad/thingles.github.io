[![page3_1.png](/assets/posts/{{ page.date | date: "%Y" }}/page3-1.png)](http://www.coconut-flavour.com/coconutbattery/)I've been thinking that my MacBook Pro's battery has been especially lightweight lately. To be honest, none of Apple's laptops do great with battery life but it's been an especially poor contender lately. I fired up [CoconutBattery](http://www.coconut-flavour.com/coconutbattery/) to check out the state of affairs and it was shocking. I'm currently only getting 39% of original battery capacity. The battery is only sucking up a measly 2,187 mAh out of a rated 5,500 mAh.
I'm going to try a series of battery conditioning cycles and see if I can get this thing back. In January I was right around 90% of capacity and the battery has only gone through 237 cycles in its 20 month lifespan.
