I really like my coffee. The apartment we are staying at here in London doesn't have a coffee pot. There is a french press, and I'm not opposed to pressed coffee. It's some good stuff. But, we are out and about everyday and I've just decided to get my daily espresso _somewhere_ instead.
This is the [double at Harrod's](/thingelstad/harrods-worlds-largest-something) -- great stuff.
