I really dig my iPhone and it seems to get better and better with every software release. However, I really wish that Apple would add a feature to **block certain WiFi networks**. Here is a screen that all iPhone owners are very familiar with:

[![iPhone-Network-Selection-Small.jpg]({{ site.url }}{% link /assets/posts/2008/iphone-network-selection-small.jpg %})]({{ site.url }}{% link /assets/posts/2008/iphone-network-selection.jpg %})

Here is the problem with this screen, I see it all the time! I have no idea what the "2WIRE251" network is but I never, ever want to see it since I will never, ever use it. I'm not a customer of the "USI Wireless" network, and would rather not see that. I have no use, ever, for the "Available Now MPLS Wir..." or "City of Minneapolis Publi..." networks.

Please Apple, give us the ability to block networks like these and **stop** prompting to join networks that I know I will never want to join.

While I'm on this screen, it would also be great to have a checkbox to only join a given network once and not save it for the future. I'm guessing almost all iPhones have a saved preference for "NETGEAR" or "Linksys" networks and I find myself on some broken network named that on a frequent basis.

While I'm dreaming, it would be so nice if a WiFi network could advertise itself as a captive portal. For example, three of those networks in the screenshot claim to be open, but they are not. They are captive portals only useful for customers of the service. We need another type available beyond secured and open.
