![logo.gif](/assets/posts/2008/logo.gif)This rolled by in my newsfeed a few days ago and caught my eye. The New York Times had a short piece on Minneapolis getting some [new high-speed options from Comcast](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/04/02/comcast-to-bring-speedier-internet-to-st-paul/). I found the [release on Comcast's website](http://www.comcast.com/About/PressRelease/PressReleaseDetail.ashx?PRID=741) about it as well.
Comcast is rolling out this new DOCSIS 3.0 technology and it promises to give us 50 megabit download speeds. That's a whopping 10x on what I get now on a regular basis. The service is about 2.5x as expensive as well, but I'd seriously consider the upgrade.

I checked out my service area and this isn't an option for me yet. Does anyone see this as an option yet? Supposedly it's available now.
