About three years ago [Dante Vono](http://www.flickr.com/photos/dvono/) sent around some links to [photos he had taken in Italy](http://www.flickr.com/photos/dvono/sets/265136/). They were really great photos, but what hit me more was that he had taken a [handful of them with an audio recording](http://www.flickr.com/photos/dvono/tags/audio/) as well. I looked at those photos and listened to the audio and was amazed at how the sound just transported me to the place. Arguably, it was more powerful than just watching a video of it.
Inspired by his example, I attempted to do something similar using my Zoom H2 in [Glacier National Park](http://www.nps.gov/glac/). Hit play to experience this picture fully. I like how you can hear the rapids in the background with the water dripping off the rock over the top.
