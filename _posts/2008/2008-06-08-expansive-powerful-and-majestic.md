Our Summer of Love trip was never intended to be a camping or hiking trip. We booked all of our visits in hotels and motels and have stuck to restaurants.
We have had three stops in national parks on the trip and they made a big impact on me. Each one of them represented another facet of nature, facets that we too often forget.


Glacier National Park: **Expansive**  

Mount St. Helens: **Powerful**  

Redwood Forest: **Majestic**


Humbling.
