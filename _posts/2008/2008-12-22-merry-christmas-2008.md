Merry Christmas everyone! This year is a travel year for us. We'll be heading back to North Dakota to spend Christmas day with my family. We are looking forward to seeing everyone!
If you've been checking your mailbox anxiously awaiting the arrival of the Thingelstad letter, or even just a card, you've been sadly disappointed on your daily trip to the mailbox. No card this year.

We could be bleak and blame it on the economy. We could be green and hightlight how much carbon we are saving by not sending out more cards and saving some trees while we are at it. We could also highlight that the trend seems to be that we only write a Christmas letter **every other** year. We had a letter in [2007](/thingelstad/2007-holiday-letter) and [2005](/thingelstad/2005-christmas-letter). The even years, [2006](/thingelstad/merry-christmas-2006) and [2004](/thingelstad/merry-christmas), seem to fall short. But mostly, we just didn't get one done and didn't feel strongly about getting one out.

We'll store up the enthusiasm though and 2009 should be pretty great! :-)
