I always feel bad that Izzy and Chase don't get enough exercise. We are pretty bad at getting them the walks that they really could use. One of my commitments for the summer is to get into the habit of getting them out every day. We've done some nice 60 to 90 minute walks the last three days.

They love it. Its good exercise for them. And I can certainly use any exercise I can get as well. It definitely mellows Chase to get a good walk in. Izzy is still her usual hyperkinetic self, but maybe a little better.Here are our two routes we've taken so far, Dog Walk East and Dog Walk South.
