[![](/assets/posts/{{ page.date | date: "%Y" }}/im_az_logo.gif)](http://www.ironmanarizona.com/)My brother-in-law [Hector](http://www.iwilltri.com/) is racing in [Ironman Arizona](http://www.ironmanarizona.com/) this weekend!
On Sunday morning he is going to do the epic 2.4 mile swim, 112 mile bike and 26.2 mile run. It's a pretty amazing feat, and it's his 2nd Ironman ([he did Ironman Wisconsin](http://iwilltri.com/2007/09/ironman-race-report/) last year).

His [bib number is 297](http://ironmanlive.com/events/ironman/arizona) and you can follow his progress yourself at [Ironman Live](http://www.ironmanlive.com/).

Hector's put in [countless hours of training](http://iwilltri.com/tag/ironman-arizona/), and having one Ironman under his belt is no longer a rookie to the race. I expect he's going to do awesome.

Good luck Hec! Rock it!

#### Update

Hector just finished the Arizona Ironman. He put in an awesome time of _10:57:50_ and placed 191st position overall. Awesome job dude! I'll add a link here to his post-race write-up in a few days.
