This will be brief since I'm posting it from my iPhone. I spent the night with my brother-in-law [Hector](http://hmfernandez.com) getting his Mac all souped up with Leopard and spiffing out his blog, [I Will Tri](http://iwilltri.com) That is neat and all but what is cool is just how fun it is. Jamming with your Mac and getting jiggy with WordPress is just fun! How many technologies can you say that about!
