![A8xae9x69x1.jpg](/assets/posts/2008/a8xae9x69x1.jpg)Mazie and I had our very first [Tiny Tonka T-Ball](http://www.minnetonkacommunityed.org/insight/registry/classinfo.asp?courseID=34900&catID=) game last night. Sorry, no pictures or video from it. Tammy had plans, and I'm one of the **coaches**! Next week we'll get some media coverage.
Of course [Mazie just turned 3](/thingelstad/daddys-girl-turns-three) a couple of weeks ago and you may be asking how exactly t-ball works with 3 and 4 year olds. Let me explain a bit.

First, this is for fun and there are no scores, no strikes. In fact, there isn't much left of the "game" and it's more just fun for the kids. And fun they had!

The first "inning" the kids were really into it and having a blast. It was funny to watch the different kids. There is only one girl other than Mazie on the team and they became fast friends. They were standing in the infield with their arms around each other. On the other hand, some of the boys didn't feel like taking turns and were pushing and shoving each other to get at the ball. By the second "inning" our entire team, with one exception, was sitting on the infield with their gloves next to them playing in the dirt.

Our team, the yellow team, now known by unanimous vote as the Yellow Bees has one ringer. One of the kids is a future hall-of-famer. He can hit a line drive right up the middle, has a heck of an arm and can play all bases equally well. He was not playing in the dirt.
