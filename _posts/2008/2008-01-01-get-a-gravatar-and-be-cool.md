![avatar.php.jpeg](/assets/posts/{{ page.date | date: "%Y" }}/avatar.php_1.jpeg_1.jpeg?format=original)If you have commented on my blog you have likely noticed this blue [Gravatar](http://site.gravatar.com/) image appearing next to your post. This is the default image that appears if you have no [avatar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_%2528computing%2529), and you really should [get one](http://site.gravatar.com/signup). I've been on a total avatar kick lately. I had my own custom avatars made. I think that this is part of keeping the Internet personal and "connected". I love to fill in my OS X Address Book with pictures for people so that when they call or I get email from them I get to see them.

A gravatar is a globally used avatar. It's a service that takes your email address and creates a key to map it back to your gravatar. [Automattic](http://automattic.com/) now [owns Gravatar](http://blog.gravatar.com/2007/10/18/automattic-gravatar/) and is embedding it into [WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org/). Now there is a plugin for the OS X Address Book that allows you to [pull Gravatars into the Address Book](http://5xm.org/avatars).

So, why wait? [Go to Gravatar and personalize yourself](http://site.gravatar.com/signup). It's cool!
