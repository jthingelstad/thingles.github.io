I've struggled with my weight for a long time, my entire adult life really. In 2000 I started an intensive program working extensively with [a trainer](http://www.fionalockhart.com/) and focusing with complete obsession on my food intake. In the course of 10 months I lost 100 pounds and changed a lot. Slowly though discipline broke down and focus was lost. This chart tells the story better than words.

I've asserted myself and decided it was time to get back into shape before, see [2004](/thingelstad/day-1) and [2006](/thingelstad/game-on-time-to-lose-weight). Both of those attempts were quick failures.

I believe that when you are making major changes in life it is an opportune time to push some bigger changes through. If you're disrupting things, disrupt them big. I'm at a big inflection point in my career, so I'm making it an inflection point for fitness too. On top of that I've noticed that my lack of fitness and excess weight has become a bigger problem than it ever was before. Perhaps showing signs of getting older, my blood pressure has crept up. In order to do fun things with Mazie and Tammy I need to be lighter on my feet.

A week ago I began to work hard on this, and I'm going to keep on working hard until I get to my goals. I've got a lot of work to do, and it's going to be hard, but I'm going to hold myself accountable to it. If I pass on the appetizer or beverages at dinner you will know why. My goal is to get back below 300 by the New Year, and to reasonable fitness by next summer. If you see me attempting to be stupid, feel free to point it out. My plan to get there includes daily exercise and strictly watching food.

Wish me luck! I'm feeling great!
