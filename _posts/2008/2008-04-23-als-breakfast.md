A few days ago I got a hankering for hash browns. It seems most breakfast places have moved to potato wedges which are a far, far cry from hash browns as they were intended to be. I was thinking hash browns, and got thinking about [Al's Breakfast](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al's_Breakfast). It had been a few years since I had been to this college mainstay so I emailed [Jim](http://www.jimbernard.net/) and [Kent](http://www.thetangens.net/) to see if they wanted to hit Al's for breakfast before work soon. Off we went!

It turns out that this was a big trip to Al's. Jim had never been and had wanted to go for years and years. Kent wasn't sure if he had been there. He thought no but let's just say his recollection was foggy. We all had a great breakfast. I couldn't resist ordering a single "whole wheat wally black" and one of their great omelets. And of course, with a side of hash browns.

Aside from the food, the place is a total dive. :-)
