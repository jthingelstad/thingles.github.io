I was just updating our oldest Mac, my original MacBook (black) that is now pretty much Tammy's laptop. I was upgrading it to 10.5.6 and realized two things.



  1. It was way behind in updates. I'm usually so good with this, but 6 updates to apply? Yikes!


  2. The battery is so wasted that it couldn't even make it through the update process. Ouch! I fired up [CoconutBattery](http://www.coconut-flavour.com/coconutbattery/) to see how bad it was and promptly ordered a new battery.

184 load cycles and 31 months isn't horrible though.

#### New Battery

Took a quick trip to the Apple Store and got a new battery. The old black MacBook is now like new! Actually, better than new looking at the numbers.
