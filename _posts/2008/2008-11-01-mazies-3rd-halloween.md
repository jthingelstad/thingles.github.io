Mazie greeted her 3rd Halloween with much excitement and anticipation. I think this is the first holiday that she has been really, truly excited about. She kept asking us in the weeks preceding when it was going to be Halloween. She was practicing saying "Trick or Treat" and "Thank You". She couldn't decide if she was going to go with her Princess outfit or the Train Conductor. In the end she decided that her love of trains would prevail.

She had an awesome night and was giddy with excitement. It was all just great.
