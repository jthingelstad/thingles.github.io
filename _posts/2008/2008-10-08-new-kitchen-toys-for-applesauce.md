I like to cook. I find it relaxing and fun. We have also been trying to keep things simpler, less processed things and make more of our own foods with the basics from [the co-op](http://www.lakewinds.com/store/). Tammy is going to start baking artisanal bread. I've started making applesauce for Mazie here at home. (Yes, baby steps. I was inspired by [my sister-in-law](http://www.lundeenscene.blogspot.com/) who makes her own food for [my niece](http://lundeenscene.blogspot.com/2008/10/ten-things-we-love-about-nora-on-month.html)!)
[![Bamix-Stick-Blender.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/posts/2008/bamix-stick-blender.png)](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00061MNIA/?tag={{ site.affiliate.amazon }})I made the first batch last week and it was really easy, except for peeling the apples which took a long time. I also couldn't get the applesauce as smooth as I really wanted it.

I had never seen an apple peeler. Tammy suggested that we just get one since they make peeling apples a breeze. I got the [Norpro Apple Peeler](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0014CXGB8/?tag={{ site.affiliate.amazon }}) at [Kitchen Window](http://kitchenwindow.com/) and used it for the first time tonight. It is amazing, and its fun! I had 5 pounds of apples ready to boil down for applesauce in no time at all. I have no idea how my mother and grandmother never produced one of these in the kitchen when making an apple pie. I can only assume that there is some big issue where these cannot be "exported" to North Dakota. Put down the paring knife, and get one of these things.

The next challenge was making it smoother so we finally picked up a stick blender, something we've been thinking we need for a long time. We make a decent number of pureed soups and a stick blender makes that so much easier. We got the [Bamix stick blender](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00061MNIA/?tag={{ site.affiliate.amazon }}) for its power and durability. It made short work of the boiled down apples and made a great, smooth sauce.

Chill it down with a little brown sugar, high-end cinnamon and fresh ground nutmeg. Knocks the socks off of any applesauce you can get in the store.
