I've been trying to post updates from the Summer of Love trip pretty regularly but we seem to have arrived and left Seattle without even a mention of the stop. So, rather than backdating some posts (which I always feel gross doing) I'll just do a big recap post. If you get bored easily, suffice it to say that Seattle was really cool.

#### Put on Your Walking Shoes

We did a lot of walking in Seattle. After being in the car for three long days of driving interspersed with a decent amount of driving at [Glacier National Park](http://www.nps.gov/glac/) we decided to park the Honda and set out on foot. We stayed on the fringe of downtown, about 5 blocks from [Seattle Center](http://www.seattlecenter.com/), and about a 10 block walk from downtown Seattle. We probably walked around 4 miles or more total each day. It was nice to stretch the legs and see the city up close. However, the downside of this was that we didn't get much further out of downtown than our feet allowed.

#### Great Places

We found a number of great places to check out. The first full day we were in town we found the Elliot Bay Trail and had a nice morning walk while checking out Puget Sound. Then we had a nice coincidence of being in town during the [Northwest Folklife Festival](http://www.nwfolklife.org/P_F/festival.html). We didn't plan it but we really enjoyed checking it out, listening to some music and hanging out in Seattle Center.

We decided, and Mazie let us know, that it was high time she got to swing. She was looking for the swings when we got to Glacier National Park. It was high time she needed to do some swinging. We walked over to Cascade Park and Mazie was able to get a solid hour of swinging in before we went over to the Flagship REI store. I feel a little odd gushing about a store, but this [REI in Seattle](http://www.rei.com/seattle) is amazing. Just entering it you go on a little mini hiking path and can't help but want to buy some hiking boots by the time you get into the store. Plus, they had the perfect layout with the play area for the kids, sitting area for dad with free WiFi and the massive array of womens clothing for mom. Genius.

We checked out the [Experience Music Project](http://www.empsfm.org/). The architecture of the EMP is pretty amazing, so even just visiting the building was a lot of fun. They had a great exhibit on Jimi Hendrix as well as an overview of music of the northwest, with a big spread on grunge music and related bands. It was a cool place, but not the best place for little kids. In contrast though, it would be a great place for older kids, and there were a lot of them there having a great time.

#### Great Eats

We had some good meals in Seattle but two places were really great. We had some [amazing pizza](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jthingelstad/2533219414/in/set-72157605315480517/) at [Tutta Bella](http://www.tuttabellapizza.com/) followed with some great gelato. And we had a wonderful dinner at the [Five Spot](http://www.chowfoods.com/5-spot) with a relative of mine that lives in Seattle. We liked it so much we made a return visit for breakfast before we left and had the most amazing cinnamon french toast I've ever had.
