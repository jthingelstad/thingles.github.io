A few days ago I watched this amazing video that was created on the brand new [Canon 5D Mark II](http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&fcategoryid=139&modelid=17662). I was going to put a link to it on my site, but when I went to found it I was greeted with this screen.

What? [Canon USA](http://www.usa.canon.com/) has "EXCEEDED [THEIR] DOWNLOAD CAPACITY" (the all-caps is courtesy of them). Does anyone at Canon realize how ridiculous it makes them look to have this message on their site? I'm wondering if maybe Canon just hosts at Dreamhost or something.

Canon, if you are going to tell people about how serious you are about amazing imaging and beautiful video, the first place to start is by being able to serve that content to the web. And please never use [ALL CAPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_caps).

Apparently the video will be back up "shortly" and I'll post a link to it then.
