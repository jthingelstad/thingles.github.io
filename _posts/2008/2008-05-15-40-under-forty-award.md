The process to be selected involves a nomination process. The editors receive letters from people and then sift through those to figure out who to pick. My sincerest thanks to [Dan Grigsby](http://www.unpossible.com/) who threw my name into the ring first, as well as everyone else who suggested me for this award. Lastly, thanks to [John Riedl](http://www.cs.umn.edu/~riedl) for taking the great quotes. **Thank you!**
The Business Journal has been doing this award for at least 11 years now ([2006 Winners](http://twincities.bizjournals.com/twincities/stories/2006/05/08/daily50.html), [2007 Winners](http://twincities.bizjournals.com/twincities/stories/2007/05/14/daily34.html)). [Dan Grigsby is also a winner this year](http://www.unpossible.com/2008/05/09/40-under-40/). Looking in the past years I see [Andrew Eklund](http://www.ciceron.com/aboutus_management.asp?emp_id=35) of [Ciceron](http://www.ciceron.com/). Going all the way back to 1999 shows my friend and founder of [BigCharts](http://www.bigcharts.com/), Philip Hotchkiss. It's great to join such company.

This is a great way to cap off the last decade as I transition into the next chapter. A cherry on the top if you will.

There is a dinner tonight at the [Minneapolis Club](http://www.mplsclub.org/) for this event. Looking forward to meeting everyone else!
