We are having a great time here at [C-Lazy-U](http://www.clazyu.com/). Every evening they send the horses out to the pasture for the night, and the wranglers get up early to go get them back in for the day. Sometimes they send them down the main road to a pasture across the way, and it makes for an amazing sight, and sound.
