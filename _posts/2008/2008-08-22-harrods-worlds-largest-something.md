![harrods-logo-gold.gif]({{ site.url }}{% link /assets/posts/2008/harrods-logo-gold.gif %})This morning we decided to head to [Harrods](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrods) ([store](http://www.harrods.com/harrodsstore/)) and visit the _worlds largest department store_. My first piece of advise is to treat Harrods like an amusement park. Don't plan to actually shop there unless you want to burn through significant £'s. There is some nice stuff there, but the prices match it. I was thrown back by kids shirts marked at £79.95 ($149.97 as of today). But then again, I don't think I've even seen [Juicy Couture](http://www.juicycouture.com/) for 3 year olds. [1] Tammy compared Harrods to a casino without the gambling, which is a good approximation. Cruise ship would also be close, but not nice enough.
Even with the ridiculous price tags we had a really fun time just walking around. Mazie had a blast in the kids department with loads of toys and babies. She got to pick one thing to get and much to her parents chagrin desperately wanted a baby that we could get for $12 at home but got to pay £14.95 ($28.04) for.

It was fun to walk around in the household stuff and see all the cool Euro fixtures and such. There are so many more modern options here than at home. We stayed from open through lunch and had some very good pizza in the food hall followed by a nice gelato for desert. We wisely chose a weekday for our visit, and also chose the morning to avoid larger crowds in the afternoon. Happily we didn't have to queue a lot and could tell that the afternoon was getting notably busier as we left.

[1] Short aside -- I think this is so funny. The Juicy Couture website, which sells way overpriced clothes based entirely on brand appeal, has the [Sun Microsystems logo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems) for it's [favicon.ico](http://www.juicycouture.com/favicon.ico). <snicker/> Somebody at Juicy needs to call their web shop.
