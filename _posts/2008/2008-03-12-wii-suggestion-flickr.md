One of the great things about the Wii is the built in support for the Internet. The freely available [Opera](http://www.opera.com/) browser for the Wii is perhaps one of the most usable "couch browsers" I've worked with (although, still not great to use).
Apple TV Take 2 added a really great [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/) channel so you can see your friends photos on Apple TV. It's a lot of fun. This seems like a total layup for the Wii. The Wii already has an imminently useless Photo Channel that requires cards and such. How about a Flickr channel to gather friends around in the living room? Or even just a great screen saver for the Wii!

Looks great to me, how about it Nintendo?
