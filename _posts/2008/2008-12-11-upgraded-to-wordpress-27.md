I just took the plunge this evening and updated WordPress to 2.7. So far I'm pretty impressed. I wasn't sure what I would think of the new admin interface but after using it I like it a lot. I can't wait to give the automated upgrade feature a workout. If anything seems amiss, let me know.

Now the race is on to see how long it takes for good themes to come out that take advantage of the threaded comments feature in 2.7.
