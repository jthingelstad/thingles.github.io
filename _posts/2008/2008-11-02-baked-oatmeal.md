Tammy found this recipe in the October 2003 issue of [Cooking Light](http://www.cookinglight.com/) magazine and thought it would be something I would like. The recipe is originally attributed to Susan Baldwin of [Eatontown, NJ](http://www.eatontownnj.com/). She highlights that it's a great dish to reheat, and I can personally attest to that. I like to make this on the weekend and then have it for breakfast for a couple of days. On top of all that, it is pretty healthy too.
The cinnamon and fresh nutmeg are my additions. I really like the flavors they add. If you don't a nutmeg grinder you probably want to double the amount of nutmeg. Either way the raisins, walnuts, cinnamon and nutmeg are really all to taste and you could certainly experiment with other ingredients as well.

#### Ingredients



  * 2 cups uncooked quick-cooking oats


  * 1/2 cup packed brown sugar


  * 1/3 cup raisins _(more or less to taste)_


  * 1 tablespoon chopped walnuts _(more or less to taste)_


  * 1 teaspoon baking powder


  * 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon


  * 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg


  * 1 1/2 cups fat-free milk


  * 1/2 cup applesauce


  * 2 tablespoons butter, melted


  * 1 large egg, beaten

  1. Preheat oven to 375°.


  2. Combine dry ingredients in a bowl. Combine the wet ingredients separately. Add the wet to the dry and mix thoroughly. Pour into greased 8-inch square baking dish. Bake at 375° for 20 minutes.
