Today is pretty much summed up with one picture, and if you are familiar with this location you know exactly what we did today. :-)

Visiting the [Royal Observatory](http://www.rog.nmm.ac.uk/) was something that I always thought would be kind of cool, and a few weeks back I realized that it would be an easy day trip while in London. We took a boat up the [Thames](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Thames) and got a fun introduction to several of the buildings that line it and after about an hour we got to Greenwich Pier. We grabbed some fish and chips in a pub and then walked up to the Royal Observatory.

It's no secret that I'm a pretty big geek, and visiting 0Â° longitude pretty much made the geek-o-meter peg into the red. I was more impressed with this arbitrary line in the dirt than I ever expected I would be. A huge bonus was the [Time Gallery](http://www.nmm.ac.uk/server/show/ConWebDoc.20428) which had [John Harrison](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Harrison)'s original time keepers on display -- H1, H2, H3 and [H4](http://www.jmr.nmm.ac.uk/server.php?show=conMediaFile.10777&navId=890&PHPSESSID=1edb8d47cb9eb907c2b31e1ef586d181). I had read about these amazing time pieces in Dava Sobel's book [Longitude](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0140258795/?tag={{ site.affiliate.amazon }}) a while back. It was amazing to see them first hand, still working.
