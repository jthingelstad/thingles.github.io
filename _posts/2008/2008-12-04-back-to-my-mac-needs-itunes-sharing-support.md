I'm now working full-time on my Mac's and I've been surprised by how useful the Back to My Mac feature has been. I had never really used it before, but it's great to be able to be in a coffee shop and grab a file off of my Mac Pro at home, or even control its screen.

There is a feature though that would be so welcome in Back to My Mac. File Sharing and Screen Sharing is wonderful, but please add support for shared iTunes libraries. It would be so nice to be able to access any of the iTunes content from home wherever I am and it would seem pretty simple given what Back to My Mac is already doing.

Please?
