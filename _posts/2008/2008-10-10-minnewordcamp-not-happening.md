Back in February I posted a feeler to see if people would be interested in [getting a Minneapolis WordCamp together]{% link _posts/2008/2008-02-16-interested-in-a-minneapolis-wordcamp.md %}. The response was pretty great, without any date, promotion or agenda [nearly 75 people](http://wiki.thingelstad.com/MinneWordCamp/SignUpSheet) signed up to indicate interest.
While there has been a lot of interest, I'm not going to be able to lead the effort to get a WordCamp going here in Minneapolis. Coordinating an event like this is far outside my interest area and not something I do all that well. Plus we weren't getting great uptake on sponsorship and the current economic meltdown is not going to make that better. We also lost our keynote speaker and were again going to have to look for a new date.

I'm hopeful that someone else is interested in seeing this happen and may take the lead and run with it.
