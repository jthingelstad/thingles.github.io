Most years at my mother's office they invite family, and especially grandkids, to join the festivities at their holiday party. This year was at [Bunker Park Stables for a hay ride](http://www.bunkerparkstable.com/hay-rides.php)! It was really cold, and we had some very off-key singing during our very cold 1-hour hay ride. Even with that, we all had a really good time.

I think the whole thing was saved by my sister bringing a sleeping bag for us to sit on, rather than sitting straight on ice!
