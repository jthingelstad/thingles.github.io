I came home tonight and was excited to see the first significant work on the excavation around the house.
This digger was in the front yard getting its work done.

We have two really big holes that will have forms put in them for the concrete around the egress windows.

It isn't often that you get to check out the exterior wall of your basement.

The toys are parked in the yard for the night.
