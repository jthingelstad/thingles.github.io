The fancy [built-in](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/built-in) cabinetry was put in today for the family room. It looks really great. There is still one part to add, the floating granite shelf that goes a few inches above the white drawers on the bottom (the dark line in the picture is the inset for it). The TV will get mounted in place along with the in-wall speakers for surround sound very soon.
