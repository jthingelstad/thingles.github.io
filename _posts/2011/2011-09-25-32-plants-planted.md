The landscapers were here this week and got the yard looking a lot better. We decided to do the planting ourselves though and took advantage of 50% off sales in September at [Wagners](http://wagners.biz/). We left with 32 plants and got them all in today. I did most of the digging and Tammy and Mazie put them in the ground. It looks great and the plants should have plenty of good weather to get established before winter.
