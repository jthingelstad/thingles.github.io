[Minnehaha Creek](http://www.minnehahacreek.org/) was picturesque this morning coming through [Minnehaha Creek West Park](http://www.minneapolisparks.org/default.asp?PageID=4&parkid=496) with a light fog from the snow melt. The creek appears thawed when still frozen. An entire stream of ice melt is flowing on top of the frozen creek.
