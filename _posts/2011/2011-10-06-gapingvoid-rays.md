My daily [gapingvoid](http://gapingvoid.com/) cartoon showed up in my mailbox this morning with Gloop. It seemed like a good message for the day.

<blockquote>
This is a character I created when I was in college named “Gloop”. Still, he turns up as a makeshift alter ego in drawings every now and then.

Gloop represents the human spirit that is still fighting to keep its dignity and self-belief when circumstance humbles us beyond all recognition. It represents the little voice in the back of our minds assuring us that hope does spring eternal even in the worst of times.

This is for all of the start up guys, the going-deeper-into-debt-grad students and all of us who know that by believing in ourselves we will wind up in a better place.

About those rays of hope—they’re still there and we still need them.
