Mazie and I put on our snow shoes and went for a loop around [Minnehaha Creek West Park](http://www.minneapolisparks.org/default.asp?PageID=4&parkid=496) and down Minnehaha Creek. Great day for snowshoes!
We stopped for a quick photo on our way to see the [Huge Snowman](/thingelstad/huge-snowman)!

Mazie was a pretty big fan of [her snowshoes](http://www.rei.com/product/805262).
