Okay, these monthly text messages from AT&T; drive me crazy.

Let me inventory all the ways these are annoying:



  * They seem to come at the worse times. I was having a busy day at work and got this interruption. Thought it was something important. It was a text message after all. But, no, it was a billing notice.


  * No human intelligence has been encoded into the scheduling of these. Can you believe I got one of these on Christmas Day? Yeah, Merry Christmas to you too!


  * The language is arcane. Get rid of the cruft and make the wording something that seems natural.

Okay, that's enough. I just needed to say that.
