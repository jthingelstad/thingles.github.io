I finally got a chance to watch [Inside Job](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_Job_(film)) tonight. Wow. Very good documentary on the financial collapse. For those that have read a bit about the issue the recap of [CDO's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collateralized_debt_obligation) and [Swaps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_default_swap) will be redundant, but it's not much. The skewering of the ratings agencies and the economic profession is pointed.
