This weekend we had friends over for dinner and I tried something new. I decided to try making my lasagna on the Big Green Egg. The Egg can work as an oven, so why not?
I was also doing a squash for the side dish so I fired up both grills to get cooking.

I made the lasagna exactly as I would have otherwise but instead of putting it in the oven I simply popped it into the Egg.

The squash got some brown sugar and butter with nutmeg and cinnamon.

The lasagna came out pretty good. I learned a couple of things.



  * I placed the lasagna directly on the plate setter, with feet down. This was a bad call. The plate setter I suspect was hotter than 350Â° and it caused some burning in the pan. I should have done it feet up with the grid on to keep the pan isolated.


  * The lasagna comes out with a smoky flavor. It reminded me of smoked mozzarella. Just a thought, you could cover the lasagna with tinfoil for half of the time to reduce the smokiness. You could pretty much dial it wherever you want.


  * I would recommend using a ceramic baking dish. I used an enameled pan, and it was okay but I think a ceramic dish would have provided some needed protection for the pasta in the grill.

I liked the end product and would definitely do lasagna in the Egg again.
