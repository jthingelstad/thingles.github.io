This was a big week for the project! The painting is mostly done now. The final colors are on all the walls, the tape is off, the trim is all painted. The railing is finished above the mudroom and I'm really excited about the space up there. I'm completely sold on putting a door in next year. The utility and electric rooms are complete enough that we were able to move a bunch of stuff back in. I was super excited to get the network and low voltage systems coming back together. Both built-ins were completed as well. The fence was installed around the egress window wells. One of the carpenters even came on Sunday and finished the railing on the front door and the new surround around the front door.

The coming week should be the last big week. The final electrical work is starting on Monday. The cork flooring is installed in the exercise room on Wednesday, and carpet is the next day. The theatre and network wiring should be all done as well. We've now taken down the plastic barrier in the kitchen so we can now get into the new space without going outside. Just a bit more now!
