Last year we had some hardscaping done in our backyard. We created a little planting area next to the garage. This year I'd like to plant it but am not sure what to plant.
The area is almost always in the shade, so we need plants that do well with low light. We only want native plants and have a strong bias for perennials. I could see a couple of annuals if they really added to it. I like tall native grasses but I'm guessing the constant shade will be a problem.

Any suggestions from Minnesotan "green thumbs" reading? Here is a photo of the planting bed alongside the garage.
