title: Electrician named Sparky

The last two build-outs that I've worked through at the office have had the same electrician and everyone always calls him Sparky. It is his nickname. I've always thought it was a fun nickname, or concerning since sparks aren't what you want with electricity.
Today at our remodel I overheard the framers talking about Sparky being done in this area or still working over there. Is Sparky just a nickname for all electricians on job sites?
