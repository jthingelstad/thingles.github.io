A few weeks ago we went back to North Dakota for a long weekend to visit my Grandma Rose. In her house she has this needlework display with the names of all the grandchildren, my cousins, on it. Fifteen names in total.
I've seen this many times. My mother is the one that did the needlework on it. But now, with my own family in mind, I stood there in recognition for what it represented, **family**.
