Our driveway provides almost **no** opportunity for me to get snow out of the way. I blow a lot of it over the fence into the backyard, but I also blow a lot of it against my neighbors garage. There is a limit to how high you can go though.
I've debated next fall creating a series of wood shelves to set next to the neighbors garage. I could then blow the snow vertically into the shelves and I could get it 10 or 12 feet in the air. It would work as a form of [snow fence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_fence).
