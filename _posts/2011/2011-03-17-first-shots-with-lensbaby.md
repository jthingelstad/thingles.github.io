For Christmas this year Tammy got me a fun lens for my camera, the [Lensbaby Composer](http://www.lensbaby.com/lenses-composer.php). When [I did the Stone/Steel/People workshop](/thingelstad/photo-book-stone-steel-people) I mentioned that my pro friend [Layne](http://www.laynekennedy.com/) was obsessed with shooting with his Lensbaby. I thought it would be a fun option to have in my camera bag and Tammy decided it would be a fun present. I haven't been shooting much but I used it when I was in Grand Marais this last weekend and here are some shots with it. These were all shot on manual at f/4.
