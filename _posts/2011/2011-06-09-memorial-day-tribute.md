My friend [Dennys Bisogno](http://www.dennysphoto.com/) is a great photographer and is now doing some video work as well. Here is a video he did for Memorial Day in River Falls, Wisconsin. Touching.

He shot this on his Canon 1D and edited in Final Cut. The clip of the elderly soldier walking down the path at 3:40 is just great.
