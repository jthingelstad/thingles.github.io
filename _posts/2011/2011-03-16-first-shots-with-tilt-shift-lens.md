While I was [shooting this weekend](/thingelstad/me-shooting-on-artists-point) in Grand Marais I took an opportunity to try out my [new tilt-shift lens](/thingelstad/tilt-shift-lens). I really didn't know what I was doing so I just tried playing with it a bit. These two shots really struck me when I was reviewing them.

I think this shot really struck me because of the falling snow. It draws my eye into the center and the snow flakes suspended in the air. I also like the mood of the shot.

I wasn't expecting much with this shot. It's just a bunch of trees with some downed trees in the mix. I tried out the tilt and put the slight clearing in focus. I really like the effect on the rest of the frame as it blurs out. For some reason this picture makes me want to walk forward and explore the space.

More experimenting to come, including some video.
