Tammy has tried all sorts of new recipe and made some really great meals. This past weekend I wanted to cook something but I wanted something specific. I wanted to use my Big Green Egg and I wanted something spicy. For some reason eating vegan has resulted in me seeking out spicy food more than ever. The flavors are just awesome.
I paged through the [Veganomicon](http://www.amazon.com/dp/156924264X/?tag=thingelstad-20) and found the recipe for Hot-Sauce Glazed Tempeh. We had some [tempeh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempeh) that we didn't have plans for so I went for it. It had the promised spice, and the preferred method of cooking it is on a grill.

Boiled the tempeh for 10 minutes and then let it soak for an hour. I fired up the Big Green Egg and got it up to 450 degrees with the cast iron grid and cooked the tempeh with some nice searing and [caramelization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caramelization). I served it with a side of Messsy Rice (vegan alternative to Dirty Rice). The result looked nice and had great flavor. There wasn't a lot of "glaze" to it though, so I think the next time I may add a little extra pepper and a touch of sugar to the marinade for basting on the grill.
