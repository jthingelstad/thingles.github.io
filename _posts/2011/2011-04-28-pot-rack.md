After much searching Tammy found a [pot rack](http://orginnovations.com/oscommerce/product_info.php?cPath=21&products_id=28&osCsid=21902939234a1587b28448057fe2911b) that works in our kitchen. It was a bit of a bear to mount but it looks nice and seems very functional. I can tell you that the studs in that wall are not 16 inches on center.

I've struggled with the kitchen in our new house. I think this is going to make it much more pleasant to cook in.
