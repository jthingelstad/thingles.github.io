![]({{ site.url }}{% link /assets/posts/2011/Fitbit.jpg %})A couple of weeks ago I revisited the [Fitbit](http://www.fitbit.com/) site to learn more about their product. After doing some research I decided to jump in and I ordered my Fitbit. I got it last Thursday. The first setup was pretty easy and I really like how it wirelessly uploads data without me having to think about it. I'm using it both for activity throughout the day and to track sleep. I'll share some more about the results after I have some more time with it.
