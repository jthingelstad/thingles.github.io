My friend [John](http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~riedl/) asked me to present at a class of his next week at the [U of MN](http://www.umn.edu/). I took an old Keynote presentation I had from a couple of years ago to start with and ran across this slide. I don't think I could have been more wrong!

I was definitely an [OpenID](http://openid.net/) advocate at the time, and for a long time before this talk. Makes me sad though since OpenID was open, and not owned by any one company. Hyperlinks between OpenID'sÂ are such an elegant way of creating connections and is so web friendly.
