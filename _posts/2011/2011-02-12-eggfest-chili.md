This weekend I made [EGGfest Chili](http://site.outdora.com/blog/eggfest-chili-compliments-big-green-egg-871.html) for the second time. This recipe is from the new [Big Green Egg Cookbook](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0740791451/?tag=thingelstad-20). I'm a big fan!
What makes this chili unique is that you smoke it for a while on the Big Green Egg. Here is the [Le Creuset](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000NNAVOO/?tag=thingelstad-20) going on the grill.

A couple of hours later and you can see that the chili has darkened and steeped itself to deliciousness.

What was a blue pot, now looks completely black. That is the smoke residue. Don't worry, an SOS pad gets it looking like new in no time.

This is easily the best chili I've ever made.
