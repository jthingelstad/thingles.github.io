One of our favorite bands, [The New Standards](http://www.thenewstandards.com/), announced they were playing at the [Lantern Festival Gala](http://www.yinghuaacademy.org/gala/) for [Yinghua Academy](http://www.yinghuaacademy.org/).

Yinghua is a Chinese immersion school in Minneapolis and we have a few friends that send their kids to the school. We've heard nothing but good things. Tammy picked up tickets so we could support a good school and get to see a relatively small and intimate performance by The New Standards.

It was a really good show.
