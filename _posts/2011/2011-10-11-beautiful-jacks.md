[Homelink Entertainment](http://homelinkentertainment.com/) is doing all the low voltage work in our remodel. One of my goals in the project has been to have cutting edge infrastructure in a 1920's house. Thanks to the meticulous detail of Ben from Homelink, it is happening. Look at this plate! Labeled Cat 5 runs down to the rack, proper speaker terminations, coax in a separate coax patch field. **Awesome**.
