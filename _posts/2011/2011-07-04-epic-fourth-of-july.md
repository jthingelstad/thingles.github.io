Today was the best Independence Day in memory. The day started early.



  * Pancake breakfast. Mazie and Tyler both love pancakes.


  * Trip to [Minnesota Zoo](http://www.mnzoo.org/). Tyler digs the zoo.


  * Swimming at the [Edina Pool](http://www.ci.edina.mn.us/content/facilities/aquatic_center/index.htm). Mazie's new favorite place.


  * Mazie's favorite dinner, [Cheeseburger Pie](http://wiki.thingelstad.com/wiki/Cheeseburger_Pie).


  * Tammy and Mazie to [Mr. Popper's Penguins](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1396218/).


  * Mazie and I went the [Minneapolis fireworks](http://www.mplsredwhiteboom.com/). Awesome!

To top that off we even had an impromptu visit from Grandma Rosalin that involved coloring.

Mazie said everything today was her favorite thing. :-)
