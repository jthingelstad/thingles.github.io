![](/assets/posts/2011/Foo-fighter-logo-small.jpg)It has been a day since the [Foo Fighters](http://www.foofighters.com/) show and my ears are still ringing. This had to be one of the loudest shows I've been to, and it was great.

Let me start with the bad news. [Kent](http://www.thetangens.net/) and I had talked about going to this show specifically because [Motörhead](http://www.imotorhead.com/) was opening for the Foo Fighters. Yeah, we wanted to see the Foo Fighters but we also **really** wanted to see [Lemmy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmy) and the gang. Kent put it all together and added a couple of other guys to our gang to head down to the show. Sadly, when we got to the [Mid-America Center](http://www.midamericacenter.com/) in [Council Bluffs](http://www.councilbluffsiowa.com/) there was a sign on the door saying that due to travel problems Motörhead would not be performing. Ugh!

The silver lining though was the 2nd line that said the Foo Fighters would play for 2.5 hours! When Grohl was on stage he said

<blockquote>We've got 16 years and a hundred ******* songs. How many of those do you think we can play tonight?
> 
> </blockquote>

They played all the best of them! I grabbed a couple of video snapshots from the show to give a sense of what it was like. Did I mention it was loud?


  


I had seen the Foo Fighters play on the Skin & Bones tour. That was nothing like this one. This was a hard, I might even say metal, show. Grohl and the Foos put on an amazing show.

The stage set was pretty cool. They had these 6 "video orbs" on cables that moved around and showed a variety of effects. The stage itself had video projected from underneath on the floor which I still can't figure out how they did.

There was also a small stage on a platform that lifted about 15 feet in the air toward the back of the main floor. Grohl made a few trips out there and did the solo acoustic songs in the encore on that stage.

I just love this picture that makes the stage look like it's exploding in light.
