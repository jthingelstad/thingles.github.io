This weekend we went to the Minnesota Arboretum. It was ridiculously hot and when we got done walking around we entered the visitor center and were looking for a drink.

I love this bubbler that has specific accommodations to fill water bottles, and even keeps track of how many disposable bottles were saved. Bravo! (See [Stop Drinking Bottled Water](/thingelstad/stop-drinking-bottled-water))
