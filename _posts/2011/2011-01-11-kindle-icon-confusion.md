Just yesterday [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/) released the Kindle application into the [Mac App Store](http://www.apple.com/mac/app-store/). They also released a new version of the [iOS Kindle application](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kindle/id302584613?mt=8). Time to install and update. On the iPhone I noticed that they had a new icon that put the Kindle brand front and center.

Nice. I then went to the [Mac App Store and found the old icon](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kindle/id405399194?mt=12)?

Huh? The same app, released within a day or two of each other? Maybe someone missed an email.
