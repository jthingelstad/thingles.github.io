I heard an interview with [The Black Keys](http://www.theblackkeys.com/) on [Fresh Air on MPR](http://www.npr.org/2011/01/31/133276978/the-fresh-air-interview-the-black-keys). That is probably the least hip way I could describe discovering a cool band like The Black Keys. I picked up their new album [Brothers](http://www.theblackkeys.com/product/brothers-cd) and am loving it. I highly recommend it!

Make sure to turn up the volume, especially on "Black Mud".
