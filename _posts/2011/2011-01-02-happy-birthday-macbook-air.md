I'm writing this blog post on my super light, super fast and super tiny 11" MacBook Air. Thanks to Tammy, my Mom & Kurt and my sister Alona I got a really nice surprise for my birthday.

I was very impressed with this laptop when I first saw one and I had thought of all the times when an Air would be so nice to have. Notably, you couldn't have a better bus laptop or blogging and surfing on the couch.

I'll be installing software for a while now. :-)
