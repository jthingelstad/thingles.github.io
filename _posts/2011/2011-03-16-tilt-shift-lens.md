I recently added a new lens to my [camera bag](http://wiki.thingelstad.com/wiki/Camera_Bag), the [Canon TS-E 24mm f/3.5L](http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/support/consumer/eos_slr_camera_systems/lenses/ts_e_24mm_f_3_5l). This is one of those weird [tilt-shift](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilt-shift) lenses. It's not the brand new [Mark II](http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/products/cameras/ef_lens_lineup/ts_e_24mm_f_3_5l_ii) version of this lens, but the older one that has been out for a while. It is wonderful L-glass with the great red ring.

I've just started to learn how to use it. I plan on using it mainly for creative effect and in video shooting. Wish me luck!
