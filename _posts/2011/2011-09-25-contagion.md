Last weekend Tammy and I had a nice dinner at [Kings Wine Bar](http://www.kingsmpls.com/) (one of my new favorite places) and then went to a movie. We went to [Contagion](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1598778/). It was a good movie, and if anything underplayed the kind of pandemonium that would follow the kind of epidemic depicted.

When I got up at the end of the movie all the other people in the movie theater seemed like something to get away from. :-)
