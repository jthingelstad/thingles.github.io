I was reading this very interesting [article on Bitcoins](http://launch.is/blog/l019-bitcoin-p2p-currency-the-most-dangerous-project-weve-ev.html) by [Jasan Calacanis](http://calacanis.com/) and used the term "technotarian" and then defined it in a footnote as:

> We made this term up to describe the “good people” of the internet who believe in the fundamental rights of individuals to be free, have free speech, fight hypocrisy and stand behind logic, technology and science over religion, political structure and tradition. These are the people who build and support things like Wikileaks, Anonymous, Linux and Wikipedia. They think that people can, and should, govern themselves. They are against external forms of control such as DRM, laws that are bought and sold by lobbyists, and religions like Scientology. They include splinter groups that enforce these ideals in the form of hacktivism, such as the takedown of the Sony Playstation Network after Sony tried to prosecute a hacker for unlocking its console.

Great term. A quick search also brought this [1995 definition of Technological Libertarianism](http://www.ontheissues.org/spectrum/tech_lib.htm).
