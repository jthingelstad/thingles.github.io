Tammy and I got to see a movie last night after a very, very long time. Can't even remember the last one. We went to [Midnight in Paris](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1605783/) at the [Edina Cinema](http://www.landmarktheatres.com/market/Minneapolis/EdinaCinema.htm). I really liked it. Fun, interesting and left us with a smile.
