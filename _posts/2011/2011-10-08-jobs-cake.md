We have a lot of [Apple](http://www.apple.com/) people at [8thBridge](http://www.8thbridge.com/). On Thursday we marked [Steve Jobs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs)' passing with a cake in his memory. The screen dimensions on the frosting iPhone are a bit Android-ish, but a great decorating job nonetheless.
