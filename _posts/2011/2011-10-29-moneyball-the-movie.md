Last night Tammy and I went to Moneyball. [I read the book](/thingelstad/moneyball) a while back and really liked it. I was curious what the movie was going to be like since, to me, the book didn't read like a movie at all. [Brad Pitt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Pitt) as [Billy Beane](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Beane) seemed odd to me, but was actually really good. Check out the movie, however, I would still recommend reading the book. If you're just curious about the numbers behind the book in the movie read up on [sabermetrics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabermetrics) and [Bill James](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_James). I was a little disappointed that the word sabermetrics wasn't even mentioned in the movie, however Bill James was given a number of references.
