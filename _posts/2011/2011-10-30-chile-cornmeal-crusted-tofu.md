I seem to have a [food](/thingelstad/making-soup-in-vitamix), [movie](/thingelstad/dolphin-tale), [food](/thingelstad/ratatouille-on-big-green-egg), [movie](/thingelstad/moneyball-the-movie), [food](/thingelstad/hot-sauce-glazed-tempeh), [movie](/thingelstad/margin-call) stream going here so why not add one more food. :-)
Last night we turned to the [Veganomicon](http://www.amazon.com/dp/156924264X/?tag={{ site.affiliate.amazon }}) for dinner inspiration again. You may be thinking that we only have one vegan cookbook, we don't. We have a handful and actually the Veganomicon hasn't been the dominant one. But it's been my favorite since it was so highly recommended by my friend John. I decided to make Chile Cornmeal Crusted Tofu with Southwestern Corn Pudding.

The tofu was easy to prepare and really all about technique. It came out okay, but I think I could do better. I don't think I got the tofu pressed enough, and the cornmeal I used was really coarse, too coarse. There were little hard bits in the crust of the tofu that were distracting. I also wanted some sort of sauce of the tofu. As a bonus there was extra tofu left and I think it will go great on a sandwich.

The Southwestern Corn Pudding was a star! It's in the picture above in the casserole dish behind the wok. It tasted really good, had jalape√±o to give some nice flavor and color. The sweetness of the corn was great. This is the kind of dish you could make for anyone and they wouldn't miss the cream and butter typical in corn preparations. It was also pretty easy. I used a bag of frozen corn and the whole preparation only took about 15 minutes and then baking time. I missed an opportunity to use some of my [New Mexican smoked chiles](http://www.newmexicanconnection.com/) too. Next time I'll bake this on the Big Green Egg to impart so smokey richness to it and use the premium chiles. My mouth is watering just typing that.
