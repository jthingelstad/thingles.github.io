Tammy surprised me with a [Chemex Coffeemaker](http://www.chemexcoffeemaker.com/) for Valentine's Day. I brewed a batch of coffee with it for the first time today and it was great. So smooth, nearly no acidity. This is a great option for occasions where I want a cup of coffee instead of an espresso.
