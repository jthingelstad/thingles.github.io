At the U2 360° show they had this ["gigapixel" Fan Cam thingy](http://www.u2.com/gigapixelfancam/110723/212120). It would be interesting to know a bit more about how it worked. It captures the whole crowd with a pretty high degree of detail.
It caught [me](http://www.u2.com/gigapixelfancam/110723/5710650-jamie-thingelstad) and [Tammy](http://www.u2.com/gigapixelfancam/110723/5711192-tammy-thingelstad). I look pretty dorky, munching on some popcorn before U2 came on stage.
