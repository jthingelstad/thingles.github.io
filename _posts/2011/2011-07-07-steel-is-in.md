Today the reinforcing steel arrived to insure that the basement walls never slide in over time. Modern foundations have rebar connecting the footings and walls. Older houses just had the walls built on the footings and the basement floor kept them from pushing in. Since we are lowering the floor these steel plates will make sure everything stays put.
