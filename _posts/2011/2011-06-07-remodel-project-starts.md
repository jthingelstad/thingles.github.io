This week we started the remodeling project on our house. I plan on taking photos of the process. It's a decent sized project. We are lowering the floor in the basement, putting in two egress windows, installing a new furnace and air conditioning unit and adding a mud room to the back of the house. It'll be just a little under four months. They start demolishing the floor in the basement this week.

Here is what it looks like now.
