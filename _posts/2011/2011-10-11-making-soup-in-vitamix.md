One of the things that wowed Tammy about the [Vitamix](http://www.vitamix.com/) was that you can make soup in it. Real soup. Not some cold [Gazpacho](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gazpacho). Honest to goodness hot soup. If you run the Vitamix on high for several minutes the blending action will bring the water to a boil!
She put all the ingredients in the blender, turned it on for several minutes and we had some nice, hot soup. Here is proof with my infrared thermometer.
