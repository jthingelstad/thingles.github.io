A couple of months ago I got a [Square](https://squareup.com/) credit card reader and associated Square account for my iPhone and iPad. I did it because we were (and still are) planning a garage sale and I thought it would be helpful to accept credit cards. We still haven't had that garage sale, but I got a lot of use out of Square this week.

The [B-Squad](http://www.bsquad.org/) needed new softball bats. I decided to take up the fundraising effort for the [B-Squad 2011 Bat Fund](http://wiki.thingelstad.com/wiki/B-Squad_2011_Bat_Fund). One of the biggest challenges is always just getting funds. Nobody carries a checkbook and cash isn't always on hand. I took my Square to Dusty's and within minutes had swiped six [Visa](http://visa.com/) cards. It was really easy and simple.

We completed our fundraising in a week in part because of how easy Square made it.
