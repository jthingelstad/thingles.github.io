Tammy had read [The Hunger Games](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0439023521/?tag=thingelstad-20) series by Suzanne Collins a few months ago and really like it. I had just finished reading [my book club pick](http://creativecomputerbookclub.com/wiki/Never_Let_Me_Go) Never Let Me Go and I had put the Hunger Games trilogy on my Kindle application. While on the bus into work I decided to start The Hunger Games. A couple of weeks later now and I've read them all.

I'm a slow reader, typically. Every once in a while a book will catch me and I can't put it down. [Into Thin Air](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0385494785/?tag=thingelstad-20) was like that, as was [The Omnivore's Dillema](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0143038583/?tag=thingelstad-20). I read the entire Dune series in a few weeks one summer as well. The Hunger Games was like that. The first book introduces you to this less than ideal vision of the future. The story arc is easy but very fun and enjoyable. Recommended reading, particularly for a summer vacation.

My only critique of the book is the ending of the last one. I was left wanting more, something more interesting to happen. It wasn't that it was bad, I just wanted more story.
