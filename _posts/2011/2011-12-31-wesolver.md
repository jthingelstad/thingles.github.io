I've been having a lot of fun working with [MediaWiki](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki) and particularly the [Semantic MediaWiki](http://semantic-mediawiki.org/) extensions. A few months ago a friend from when I worked at Dow Jones, [Armistral](http://www.wesolver.org/wiki/User:Armistral), asked me for some input on how he could build this website he was working on. He wanted to create a site where people could work together to solve [problems](http://www.wesolver.org/wiki/Category:Problems). Thus [WeSolver](http://www.wesolver.org/wiki/Main_Page) was born. I strongly recommended that he use MediaWiki and he ran with it. The site is now live and he's done a nice job setting it all up. Check it out and if your so inspired see what you can do to help with [a solution](http://www.wesolver.org/wiki/Category:Solutions)!
