Here is a scenario. You are doing a brisket on your Big Green Egg. It's a weekend, and the meat will be smoking on the grill pretty much all day (and possibly all night). You aren't going to serve just any barbecue sauce with it, you make your own. This requires you to simmer the sauce for hours. The longer the better. The brisket, and you, are outside having a nice day probably with a good beer. Where is your sauce? Inside on the stove? Total buzzkill. This is where you need an outdoor burner.
When I got my [Double Big Green Egg table](/thingelstad/double-big-green-egg-table) I knew I wanted to do a full meal outside, from prep all the way to eating. While I love my grills, there are some things that you need a burner for. Last year I picked up one of these [Max Burton Pro Chef 1800](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0037Z7HPQ/?tag=thingelstad-20) units from Kitchen Window and it's worked out great.

Why get this unit?



  * This is a commercial unit and it is built well. I feel comfortable with moving it in and out of storage and not needing to be overly gentle with it. (Note, it is only outside when in use. Otherwise it's stored inside.)


  * The unit is very easy to clean. The cook surface is a flat glass plate that just wipes down. The touch sensitive control surface is easily wiped down as well. When grilling my hands get dirty and this unit gets dirty.


  * I wanted a burner I could dial into a temperature, and this one can do that. If simmering a sauce I want to just punch in a temp and not think about it. Easy.

I've been really happy with it for everything from cooking pancakes for a brunch on the grill to simmering sauces or boiling some water for carrots. The only job I found it challenged by was boiling a huge kettle of water to cook corn in. It just didn't have enough power to deal with 3 gallons of water. But really, the corn should be grilled anyway.
