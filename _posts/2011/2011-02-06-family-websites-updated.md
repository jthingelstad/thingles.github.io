We took a little time this weekend and updated everyone else's websites this weekend.

Tyler now has a landing page up on his website. No blog or anything for him, just a simple page with some links. Mazie switched to a new theme and I posted a bunch of her pictures from the last few weeks. Last but not least Tammy also put a new theme on Smaller Than a Redwood.

Everyone looks clean, fresh and nicely updated!
