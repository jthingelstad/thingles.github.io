Tyler loves to climb on things, and he doesn't give up easily. This morning I had the Tour de France streaming on one of the computers and left the room for a moment. I thought Tyler was being pretty quiet and was wondering why he wasn't running around as usual. I came back to find him pretty excited to have climbed up in the chair and running the computer himself.

The kids a climber!
