On Facebook I follow a handful of people who are (semi-)famous, and I don't know but I know there work. One of those people is [Jim Brandenburg](http://www.jimbrandenburg.com/), the renowned photographer that calls Ely, Minnesota his home. Anyway, he posted today that he was selling some of his gear, and it really seems that "Ellen" isn't quiet getting it. Awkward. The ALL CAPS is just bonus.
