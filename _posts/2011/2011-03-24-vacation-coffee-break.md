I'm on vacation this week. We [went to North Dakota]({{site.url}}{% link _posts/2011/2011-03-19-592-2-miles.md %}) earlier. Today I spent the day with Tyler and it was great. Tomorrow Mazie and I are having a Daddy/Daughter day.

While Tyler tried to nap, I did get time for a wonderful [Chemex coffee break]({{site.url}}{% link _posts/2011/2011-02-19-first-run-with-chemex.md %}). Very nice.

Note the old school [Road Sign Math](http://www.roadsignmath.com/) coffee mug. :-)
