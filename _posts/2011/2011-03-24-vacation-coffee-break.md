I'm on vacation this week. We [went to North Dakota](/thingelstad/592-2-miles) earlier. Today I spent the day with Tyler and it was great. Tomorrow Mazie and I are having a Daddy/Daughter day.
While Tyler tried to nap, I did get time for a wonderful [Chemex coffee break](/thingelstad/first-run-with-chemex). Very nice.

Note the old school [Road Sign Math](http://www.roadsignmath.com/) coffee mug. :-)
