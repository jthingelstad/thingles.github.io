[![](/assets/posts/2011/where-the-sidewalk-ends.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0060572345/?tag=thingelstad-20)Last night Mazie and I finished reading [Where the Sidewalk Ends](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0060572345/?tag=thingelstad-20) by [Shel Silverstein](http://www.shelsilverstein.com/). I really enjoyed reading each and every poem to Mazie, and she thought they were funny, goofy and good.
I distinctly remember reading Where the Sidewalk Ends when I was a kid. They were likely the first poems I read. I even remembered some of them. Mostly I remembered having the book and the cover of it.

We were reading the 30th Anniversary edition so I was at the youngest 9 when I read it. It was a real treat to read it to my daughter and hope that she has the same recollection when she reads it 30 years from now.
