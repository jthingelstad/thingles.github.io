I can't remember where I first saw [Margin Call](http://margincallmovie.com/) referenced. The movie depicts a 24-hour segment of the 2008 financial crisis. I'm a sucker for high-finance movies ([Wall Street](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094291/), [Boiler Room](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0181984/)) and knew I wanted to see it right away. Then I saw the cast and that [Kevin Spacey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_spacey) was in it, one of my favorite actors. I was happy to see it on iTunes as an "in theater rental" so we watched it in the new family room last night.

It was an odd movie. [The movie has 86% on Rotten Tomatoes](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/margin_call/), which honestly surprises me a bit. I think if you took some of the star power out and just went on the screenplay it would be much lower. Spacey is awesome, as always. The pacing of the movie I think is what had me off. It would go for long moments at a crawl and then without transition speed along. Similar to one of my favorite movies, [Glengarry Glenn Ross](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104348/), there are no heroes here.

If you watch it, share your thoughts. I'd love to know what others think of it. The [Margin Call website](http://margincallmovie.com/) is one of the better movie websites I've seen though.
