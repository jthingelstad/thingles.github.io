Sometimes a song has lyrics that are so striking you can't help but take note. This is a great section from "[Society](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0014ETRQE/?tag=thingelstad-20)" by [Eddie Vedder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Vedder) on the [Into the Wild soundtrack](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000ULQV0W/?tag=thingelstad-20).

<blockquote>
There's those thinkin' more or less, less is more,
but if less is more, how you keepin' score?
It means for every point you make, your level drops.
Kinda like you're startin' from the top...
and you can't do that.

Beautiful and makes you think.
