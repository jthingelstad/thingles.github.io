Sometimes a song has lyrics that are so striking you can't help but take note. This is a great section from "[Society](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0014ETRQE/?tag={{ site.affiliate.amazon }})" by [Eddie Vedder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Vedder) on the [Into the Wild soundtrack](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000ULQV0W/?tag={{ site.affiliate.amazon }}).

> There's those thinkin' more or less, less is more,

Beautiful and makes you think.
