Our [month of eating vegan]{% link _posts/2011/2011-09-30-30-day-vegan-challenge.md %} has a lot of new challenges. One of the biggest is what to do with my cherished Big Green Egg's. I liked that ratatouille is naturally vegan, and it seemed that cooking it on the [Big Green Egg](http://biggreenegg.com/) would be really good. I followed the [Ratatouille's Ratatouille recipe on Smitten Kitchen](http://smittenkitchen.com/2007/07/rat-a-too-ee-for-you-ee/) and instead of putting it in the oven I put it on the large Big Green Egg set up for indirect cooking.

It came out really good with a nice, light smoke flavor infused as well. I served it on a bed of couscous.

Vegan? Check. Grill? Check. Delicious? Check.

When it comes to grills and eating vegan there isn't much overlap. However, the Big Green Egg is unique since it can do anything an oven can do, but better.
