Mazie and I went and saw [Cars 2](http://disney.com/cars2) this weekend. We splurged and saw it in 3D! It was a ton of fun with a Daddy-Daughter movie and some Gummy Bears.

Mazie was excited to wear her special glasses!

I really like Cars. It is probably my favorite kids movie. I liked Cars 2. It was a lot of fun. It wasn't as good as Cars, but that is a really high bar.
