One of my favorite things about living in our neighborhood is walking around with the old, majestic trees overhead. Conversely, I get very sad when I see an orange ring spray painted around a tree indicating it has to be cut down. When I was walking to the bus this morning the crew was getting ready.

We have a huge ash in our yard that we have on a every program that [Rainbow Treecare](http://www.rainbowtreecare.com/) recommends. I hope we never lose it to invading pests.
