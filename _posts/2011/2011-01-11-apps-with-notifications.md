I've got a lot of applications on my iPhone. They are spread over multiple pages, and some of them are in folders with similar applications. I also get notifications from a lot of applications. I've found that it would be really nice if there was a way on my iPhone to see all the applications that had badge notifications for me to see. But where would you put it?
I thought about it for a bit and it hit me that it would be really cool if when you swiped left to the Spotlight screen to do a search, it could show the applications that have outstanding notifications. Something like this.

If you start to type those icons would go away and the typical search results would show instead. I think that would be pretty slick!
