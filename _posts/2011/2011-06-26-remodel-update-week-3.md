Week three of the remodel project has been substantial. Arriving home to heavy equipment in the yard is the first clue. Most of this weeks pictures are large holes dug around our house. It's proven to be a big inconvenience as we cannot walk from the front yard to the backyard easily now. This leaves Chase incredibly confused about where he's supposed to do his business in the yard.

The week ahead starts some of the framing work and the excavation of the floor in the basement. The next shots from the basement should be interesting! I love how the light comes in from outside in the basement already. I'm also pretty excited about the large windows we'll have in the basement. I think the space will feel really nice.

We lost about 3 days this week due to rain. Everyone agreed we didn't want large holes in the yard filled with three feet of rainwater.
