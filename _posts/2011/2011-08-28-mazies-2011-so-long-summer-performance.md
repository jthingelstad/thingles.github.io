Today was the 2011 So Long Summer show! Our neighbors the Miller's host this every year for five years running now. It's the last Sunday before school and a ton of kids in the neighborhood do performances. It's awesome on so many levels.
This year Mazie sang a song from her now favorite movie, Annie. She sang "It's a Hard Knock" life and knocked it out of the park!

I was so proud of her -- great job! The crappy focusing is my poor performance on my camera.
