We just hired [Quartersawn](http://www.quartersawndesignbuild.com/) as the [general contractor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_contractor) to do a house project. Upon signing the agreement every friend of mine feels compelled to share every horror story they've ever heard about how horrible general contractors and home remodeling projects can be. Thanks! :-)
