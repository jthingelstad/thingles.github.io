[Last week we had a lot of digging in the remodel project.]({{site.url}}{% link _posts/2011/2011-06-26-remodel-update-week-3.md %}) It was exciting to come home today to concrete forms poured and the new egress window openings in place as well as the foundation for the mudroom. It's great to see the forms in place!
