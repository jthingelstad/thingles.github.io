[![]({{ site.url }}{% link /assets/posts/2011/Open-Eye-Driveway-Tour.jpg %})](http://www.openeyetheatre.org/tour/driveway-tour-sites)Last week Mazie and I had a delightful evening sitting in [Garrick Van Buren](http://garrickvanburen.com/)'s backyard watching a puppet show. This is the 3rd year that the Van Buren's have hosted the [Open Eye Figure Theatre](http://www.openeyetheatre.org/) and we've made it every year. This year Garrick commented to me that he had counted over 100 people. That's great, and I hope that Open Eye continues to do this Driveway (or in this case Backyard) Tour.

Before the puppet show starts the puppeteers give a little introduction to the theatre and the puppets. They have a simple stage and are accompanied by an accordion player. Every year there is always some water moment where water will fly from the puppet area into the audience. It's a lot of fun for everyone involved.

This years show was The Amazing Cow Boat

> Taking a bath will never be the same for audiences after seeing the all-new The Amazing Cow Boat! Told through a giant pop-up book with puppets, songs, and surprises, the show is the story of Charlie who, while taking a bath, sails away in his imagination in search of treasure. Traveling in his boat that amazingly is also a cow, he encounters pirates, mermaids, a whale, and an orangutan.

While I was sitting there watching the puppet show with Mazie in my lap, I took a moment to look around at all the other families and their kids collected in this neighborhood enjoying the show. It all seemed so _right_ and so _good_. We need more things like this.
