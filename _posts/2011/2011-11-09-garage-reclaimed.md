While doing our remodel we lost the use of our garage. We used it for storage and the contractors had a big dumpster in the driveway. For most of the summer there was also a small lumber yard in the driveway and a portable toilet. So we parked on the street all summer. Best time to do it but an inconvenience.
This last weekend we got the garage cleared back out and I was irrationally excited to park both cars in there again.
