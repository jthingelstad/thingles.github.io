Some people in our neighborhood build a huge snowman in [the park](http://www.minneapolisparks.org/default.asp?PageID=4&parkid=496) every winter. Mazie stood next to it for scale. The nose is a traffic cone. Awesome!

You can see this for yourself if you drive [down Penn Ave at night and look east](http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=5237+Morgan+Ave+S,+Minneapolis,+Hennepin,+Minnesota+55419&ll=44.907464,-93.307711&spn=0.003853,0.009484&z=17) as you cross over Minnehaha Creek. They light it up at night so it stands out really well. I'm going to go and photograph it some evening.
