I have been happy having my blog hosted in Jekyll and built as a static site with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com). There is a wonderful calm to knowing you just have a bunch of HTML pages. It‚Äôs light and airy. But, and this is a big one, I've found authoring to be simply too hard. Writing using a source code workflow adds too much friction.

Tonight I‚Äôm trying out [Forestry.io](https://forestry.io) and I‚Äôm very impressed. üëç There are a number of content management tools for static sites, but I've found most of them fail immediately since I have more than 1,700 blog posts and I put them in `:year:` folders inside of  `_posts` and that simple part causes most of them to fail. Similar issues exist with where you host images. I was very happy to see that Forestry.io worked right out of the box with that. It even built nice front matter templates based on the content it found inside of my site!

I‚Äôm putting this post together to share how impressed I am, and also as a test of the posting interface. If you are using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) or [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) I would highly recommend you look at Forestry.io!
