This weekend I made some significant improvements to the automation and template for the [Weekly Thing](https://weekly.thingelstad.com/). I‚Äôve always had reservations about the template I was using since moving to MailChimp. It just didn‚Äôt fit me, and even more frustrating I didn‚Äôt have any ways to make simple changes to the styling. I use quotes extensively in the Weekly Thing, and it wasn't possible to get those quickly styled.

I got a lot done over the weekend to make this better.

### Template

I used a very [basic HTML template](https://www.sitepoint.com/accentuate-message-clean-simple-mailchimp-template/) and extended it as I need it. I wanted it simple and didn‚Äôt want a lot of decoration. I like how it ended up.

You will notice that quotes look significantly better in the links section, with indentation and a left border. I‚Äôve also added the hostname of the link, so you know what site you are going to go to if you click on that link, something I appreciate before I click on a link.

### Automation

My automation is now complete again. I figured out the MailChimp API's and my workflows now format all the content for me and then create the campaign in MailChimp, set the body content and I even got the photo uploaded with the API.

Now I can once again publish entirely on my iPhone if I want to.

### Microblog

While I was working on the template and the automation, I decided to make the microblog section better. I've never liked having those posts be a list of links. Often the only content is the text itself, and it feels disappointing to click on a link to get nothing new. But sometimes there was a photo there, so people did.

Microblogs are now directly in line with the Weekly Thing. You no longer need to click out to see an image, and you don‚Äôt get disappointed by clicking on a status post to only see a web page with nothing more than the status you already read.

Thank you for the time, and I would appreciate any feedback you have. üôè I finally feel like I can change this with some confidence and make continual improvements.
