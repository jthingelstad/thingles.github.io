I had a great time talking about [Changing the Enterprise](https://www.meetup.com/DevOps-Minneapolis/events/249870267/) at this week's DevOps Minneapolis Meetup with [Heather Mickman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/heather-mickman/) and [Bridget Kromhout](https://bridgetkromhout.com/)! My mic wasn't working in the beginning but gets fixed a little later in the video.

It was a fun opportunity to talk about some of the concepts I've thought about with risk management, refactoring costs, how Agile and DevOps come together.
