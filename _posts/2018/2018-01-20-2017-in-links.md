For years I've been keeping all of my links on [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in) and this year I decided to start publishing them at [Link Thing](https://links.thingelstad.com). I also publish [my links](https://links.thingelstad.com/feeds/) in common formats that can be downloaded. I thought it would be fun to look at all the links from 2017.

In 2017 I saved **913 links**. I most frequently create links at 8pm and 10pm, with 7am coming in next. It's interesting that I did a link in every hour of the day in 2017. Why I was linking something at 2am instead of sleeping is a different topic.

Friday is the day that I save the most links. This is a little skewed by my reading workflow which includes staging links in [Safari Reading List](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT200294) to queue up often before reading. After reading I may save a link. I almost always clear my reading list out on Friday night, before I publish my [Weekly Thing](https://weekly.thingelstad.com) newsletter.

I definitely started linking more once I started publishing the [Weekly Thing](https://weekly.thingelstad.com) in April and my link blog. Prior to that the only links I would have saved were ones I would revisit, after that I started saving links for anything I felt was worth highlighting and sharing.

I saved links from 523 different websites in 2016. That's just 1.75 links per website on average. I like the diversity of sources that represents. The top 30 websites represent 298 links, or 32.6% of all links. I was surprised to see [Medium](https://medium.com/) at the top of the list.

651 of the links I saved were secured with HTTPS, a full **71% of all links** for the year. Hats off to everyone for making the web more secure and private.

I was curious how my links spanned various top-level domains. **85% of links** are in the .com TLD. There are 29 top-level domains that I only bookmarked one or two links from.

It would be fun to take this corpus of data and do further analysis. Some graph representation of sites through domain names, analysis by countries or even sentiment and topic analysis of the links themselves would be cool. I'll defer that to next years post.
