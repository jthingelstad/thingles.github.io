My friend [David Hussman](http://davidhussman.com) likes to reference his age with a version number. He does a divide by 10 so at 32 you are version 3.2, and 47 you are version 4.7. This always makes me chuckle a bit, but I think there might be more to this than a geeky joke.

Reference [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org):

> Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
>
> 1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
> 2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
> 3. PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

I think the version metaphor works. You are a different person in your 20s, 30s, 40s and so on. Your life changes in meaningful ways! MAJOR version! Each year we tend to think of new things and new goals, but we don't break backwards compatibility. MINOR version! And I think most people try to make each day a bit better than the last. PATCH level!

Today Iâ€™m **v4.6.52** of me. I decided the patch version is the days since your birthday. In fact, I made a [Birthday Version](https://workflow.is/workflows/f207d69d37d147dcbf7d58bebb1c81b5) script for [Workflow](https://workflow.is/download) to calculate the version of people in your address book.

How will v4.6.53 be different? I don't know, but I hope ever so slightly bit better. ðŸ¤ž
