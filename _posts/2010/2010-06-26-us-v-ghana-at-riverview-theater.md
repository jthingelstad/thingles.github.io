Today my brother-in-law Hector and I went to the Riverview Theater to check out the US v. Ghana game in the World Cup. I was excited to watch the game and hopeful that the US would get past the round of 16 for the first time. Luckily Hector got there 30 minutes early or we would have been out of the luck. The place was packed.

It's hard to see the people but there wasn't an empty seat in the place. People were really into the game. After Ghana took an early lead the room was filled with energy when Donovan took his penalty kick and scored to tie the game. I grabbed 30 seconds of the screaming and yelling at that kick.

The game was on another continent, but at that moment, and many other moments, it felt like we were only a bit off the pitch. What a great game, even though we lost.
