Last week Mazie had her first soccer game! She's in the [Fuller Soccer Club](http://fullersoccer.blogspot.com/) on the Cyclones. With no practice aside from trying on her shin guards and uniform she hit the field.
This is a league for 5-6 year olds and it was a ton of fun to watch. Little kids all chasing the ball! They play 8 periods of 5 minutes each, rotating into various positions. Her first period involved a lot of standing in place and watching, but by the 4th period she was having a ton of fun!

I ran video of the entire 8th period. Mazie was playing center forward.
