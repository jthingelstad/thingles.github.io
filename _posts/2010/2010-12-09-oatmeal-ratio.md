When she was really little I would make 2 servings and she ate about ½ of a serving and I got 1½ which was just about right. Now though she wants more, and the oatmeal box only shows water amounts for 1, 2 and 6 servings. We want 3 servings!

Now I realize your probably thinking it's simple. 1 cup of water for each ½ cup of oatmeal. Done. However, that isn't right. Note that 6 servings, 3 cups of oatmeal, is 5 cups of water, not 6. Here is the graph.

So it seems if you want to make 3 servings of oatmeal, you need 2 2?3 cups water. 4 servings need 3 1?3 cups and 5 takes 4¼ cups. Hope this helps everyone with their oatmeal preparation.
