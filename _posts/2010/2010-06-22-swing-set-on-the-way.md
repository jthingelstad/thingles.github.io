We are redoing a lot of the outdoor space in the backyard of our new house. We've wanted to put in a swing set for Mazie but it was a real challenge to find something that would fit in our standard city lot. It took a lot of creative thinking but we finally figured out a way to make it work and Tammy found a swing set that would fit in the space.

Tammy ordered the unit from [CedarWorks](http://www.cedarworks.com/). They send a rendered model of the swing set when you order it. Pretty cool.
