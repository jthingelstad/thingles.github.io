[HumbleFinance](http://www.humblesoftware.com/finance/index) produces really nice looking, smooth and interactive charts in HTML5 using Canvas. Very nice. At [MarketWatch](http://www.marketwatch.com/) we had been trying to do this several years ago but it was really hard to get the user experience we wanted. I think browser technology has finally reached the point where you can do this stuff right. ([via Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/03/12/humblefinancial))
