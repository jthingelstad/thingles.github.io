I've been learning how to play [Carcassonne](http://carcassonneapp.com/) with some friends. I had the fun experience tonight of playing [Aaron](http://hillsidelounge.com/), a buddy in Singapore. He took a break during lunch on the other side of the world. I stayed up later than planned.
I lost badly. It all turned when this city blew apart on me. Note the X on the board. Ugh!
