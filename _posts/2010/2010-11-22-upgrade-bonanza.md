Some of you reading this realize how much I like to upgrade things. I really do. I'm not saying it is wise, but I feel a nearly unstoppable urge to upgrade as soon as I can. And my favorite kind of upgrade? Firmware. Upgrading firmware is absolutely delicious.
Tonight was a marvelous feast. Upgrading iOS on an iPhone 4, iPhone 3GS, two iPad's and two 2nd generation Apple TV's. Just great!
