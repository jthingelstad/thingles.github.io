A while back we were traveling and I noticed that this coffee shop, [Kavarna](http://www.kavarna.com/), didn't just have its name in its WiFi network as most do. They smartly were telling anyone that could see the WiFi signal to come on in and use the network.

Smart. More places should do this. How about **"Free Refills"** in your WiFi network name?
