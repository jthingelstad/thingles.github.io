My [Glif](http://www.theglif.com/) arrived in the mail today! I was one of the many backers on their [Kickstarter campaign](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/danprovost/glif-iphone-4-tripod-mount-and-stand). This little widget is to allow you to place your iPhone 4 in all sorts of interesting ways, including putting it on a tripod.

I already used it to tilt the iPhone up while displaying a recipe on the kitchen counter.
