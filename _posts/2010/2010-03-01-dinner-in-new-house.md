Today we closed on our new house. It was an exciting day filled with activity and signing many, many sheets of paper. To celebrate the closing we moved a handful of things into the new house including Mazie's play table and decided to have dinner at the new place from [Broder's Deli](http://www.broders.com/cucina-italiana/index.html).

We don't actually move in for a little bit after painting and some new carpet.
