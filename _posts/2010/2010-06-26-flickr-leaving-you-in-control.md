I want to take a moment to applaud [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/). It really frustrates me when websites do not give you full control of your data. I decided that I wanted to start over on Flickr and delete every picture I have. Some services make this so painful. In Flickr though, it was just a couple of clearly labeled and easily accessible clicks away.

That took a while, but when it was done I had a blank slate to start with again.

Thank you Flickr for making it very clear that I am in charge of [my account](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jthingelstad/) and what is there.
