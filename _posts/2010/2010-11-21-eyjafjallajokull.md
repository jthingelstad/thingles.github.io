My friends [Dennys Bisogno](http://www.dennysphoto.com/) and [Layne Kennedy](http://laynekennedy.blogspot.com/) sent a link around to [this amazing video](http://vimeo.com/11673745) of "[that volcano in Iceland nobody can pronounce the name of](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyjafjallajökull)" by [Sean Stiegemeier](http://www.seanstiegemeier.com/).
He captured that on his [Canon 5D Mark II](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001G5ZTLS/?tag=thingelstad-20). That is the same camera I shoot with. Seeing something like that come out of kit that is on my shelf is both inspiring and intimidating.
