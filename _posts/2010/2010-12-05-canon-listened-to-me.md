Just over a year ago I posted my plea to Canon asking that they make it so I can [lock the mode dial on my Canon 5D Mark II]{% link _posts/2009/2009-11-09-canon-let-me-lock-my-mode.md %}.
Last week they announced a [program to replace your mode dial with a locking one](http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/products/cameras/slr_cameras/eos_7d?pageKeyCode=prdAdvDetail&docId=0901e02480245968). Apparently it will cost $100. I assume it will involve a visit to an authorized service center. Worth $100? Probably.

_**Update:** I called [National Camera](http://nationalcamera.com/) today to ask about this program. They haven't heard a thing. The guy I talked to said that a number of people didn't like the new locking mode dial on the newest Canon cameras so he wasn't sure it was really something that people would like._
