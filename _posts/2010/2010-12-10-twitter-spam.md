It's clear to me that spam on Twitter continues to be a growing problem. Tonight I posted a simple [question about weather apps on the iPad](http://twitter.com/#!/thingles/status/13423265829617664).

Within seconds I got these really helpful replies from four attractive women that supposedly follow my every message, including one that seemingly has no clothes and only a bra to wear for her avatar.

I reported the accounts as spam. This stuff is so blatant though. You would think that Twitter could be doing a much better job blocking this stuff if they put any thought into it. Too much traffic? Somehow firewalls manage high traffic loads. Too complex of a problem? Don't buy it.

Maybe they don't mind it. After all, aren't each of these yet another Twitter user which increases the theoretical worth of Twitter?
