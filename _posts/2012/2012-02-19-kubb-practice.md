My buddy [Garrick](http://garrickvanburen.com/) came over yesterday and we enjoyed some practice rounds of Kubb across the street at [Minnehaha Creek West Park](http://www.minneapolisparks.org/default.asp?PageID=4&parkid=496). We played three games. The first one quickly went to him and the last quickly went to me. The one in the middle was an hour long ebb and flow of knights shifting from side to side.
