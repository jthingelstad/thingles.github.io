[MinneBar 7](http://wiki.minnestar.org/wiki/MinneBar_7) was just a little over a month ago and the videos the two sessions I did are now online.

### Running a Virtual Server with Confidence

I gave one talk on [Running a Virtual Server with Confidence](http://wiki.minnestar.org/wiki/Running_a_Virtual_Server_with_Confidence). I got a lot of really good feedback from this session, people found it really useful and adopted a number of the suggestions I made. I didn't use slides for this, instead I just walked through my build notes and shared that URL.

### Every HTTP Status Code

[Garrick](http://garrickvanburen.com/) and I also thought it would be fun to do a talk on [Every HTTP Status Code](http://wiki.minnestar.org/wiki/Every_HTTP_Status_Code). We made it fun and walked through each one.
