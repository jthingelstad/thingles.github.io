I recently decided to prune some websites that I was hosting, mostly ideas that I set up and then never took anywhere. Tammy had also decided to take her blog, Smaller Than a Redwood, down. I could have just deleted them but I wanted to be a good "net.citizen" and not give people "404Â Page not found" errors but instead the more appropriate "410 Gone" message. Here is a simple way to do this with [nginx](http://nginx.org/).
First, I catch the websites main configuration which I keep in a file for each site in `/opt/etc/nginx/sites-available`. I try to keep these configurations really simple, just handling the URLs, ports and then doing the application configuration in an include.

    # Redirect to non-www hostname
    server {
      listen 80;
      listen [::]:80;
      server_name www.roadsignwordplay.com;
      rewrite ^ http://roadsignwordplay.com$request_uri? permanent;
    }
    
    server {
      listen   80;
      listen   [::]:80;
      server_name roadsignwordplay.com;
      include /opt/etc/nginx/site-gone;
    }

The include line then pulls in this configuration. I pointed this at a new directory in `/srv/www` so that any files that the site used to have could be left wherever they are. I also turn on an access log so I can easily see how many people are still going to the website. I still do a try_files because I have a robots.txt to help search engines know to go away. The important part is returning a 410 status and not a 404. The 410 is then handled by the @site-gone rule.
    
    # this config is loaded into sites that are dead
    root /srv/www/site-gone/public_html;
    access_log /srv/www/site-gone/logs/$host-access.log;
    error_log /srv/www/site-gone/logs/error.log ;
    
    location / {
      try_files $uri =410;
    }
    
    error_page 410 @site-gone;
    location @site-gone {
      rewrite ^(.*)$ /site-gone.html break;
    }

Voila! Site is now "gone". I whipped up a simple HTML page to serve so people would know that the site was no longer available. And with that I wish Smaller Than a Redwood, Road Sign Wordplay, Road Sign Bingo, MediaWiki Cookbook, Sandbox Wiki and thinglesBot farewell!
