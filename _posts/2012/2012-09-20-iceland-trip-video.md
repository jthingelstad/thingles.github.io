I had a great time in Iceland recently with friends Steve, [Dennys](http://dennysphoto.com/) and [Layne](http://www.laynekennedy.com). Dennys made this very cool video from our trip. He brought his whole video rig along and did some great work. I really like how he cut in the driving segments and gave this a real "road trip" feel (we did drive 1,200 miles after all!). This will be a wonderful way to remember the trip. A recap blog post on the trip is in the works for this weekend.
