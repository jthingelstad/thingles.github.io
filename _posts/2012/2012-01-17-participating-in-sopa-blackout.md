On January 18th at midnight all of my personal websites will be going dark to [protest the proposed SOPA and PIPA bills](http://americancensorship.org/) being discussed in congress. I'm joining sites like [Wikipedia](http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/English_Wikipedia_anti-SOPA_blackout) and [Reddit](http://blog.reddit.com/2012/01/stopped-they-must-be-on-this-all.html) in this process. I realize I don't get a lot of traffic, but I felt it was important to join in. My sites will be in protest display from 8 AM to 8 PM central time.
