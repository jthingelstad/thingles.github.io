Today I got to take Tyler to [Berry Patch](http://www.berrypatchschool.com) for pre-school to attend Dads and Donuts day! Tyler was **super** excited for Dad to come to school with him. We played with Play-Doh while everyone arrived. We then went in and talked to Fireman Tom from the Edina Fire Department. Tyler was sitting up front and volunteered to come up front and try on a fire fighter suit! He was so excited!
He got to stand in fireman boots:

After our talk with Fireman Tom we went out front and got to see a ladder truck up close! Tyler posed with Ms. Anita for a picture in front of the truck.

We finished with a delicious donut with another fire truck on the table!
