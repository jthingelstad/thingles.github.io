While in Wabasha for the weekend we spent the morning at the [National Eagle Center](http://www.nationaleaglecenter.org).

Mazie and I also attended one of their workshops and learned a lot about the Bald Eagles and got to see one of them have lunch.

Definitely a fun place to stop in Wabasha on your next trip!
