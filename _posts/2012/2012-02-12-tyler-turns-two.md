**Tyler turned two today!** We had a festive birthday party with family over last weekend so that Hector and Michelle could join in the fun from New York. Today was his actual birthday and we had a nice day together to celebrate the big day!
Tyler got a fun mobile from Mazie for his room, and a cool race car toy from Tammy and I. Tyler and I made a trip to A Baker's Wife's donuts in the morning, Tyler is a big fan of their sprinkled donuts. They gave him an extra one for free for his birthday! We had a fun morning playing, jumping, sliding and wrestling on the floor.

For lunch Tyler got one of his favorites, the Mac and Cheese at [Yum!](http://www.yumkitchen.com/) Mazie had a friend birthday party today that worked perfectly with Tyler's nap and afterwards we went to [Edinborough Park](http://edinboroughpark.com/) in Edina for more playing.

Tyler at two is constantly moving, playful, funny, opinionated, kinetic. Not much of a talker, but I think the words are coming very soon. He's a complete monkey and will climb anything you put in front of him. Tyler gives me an awesome gift every day when I come home from work. He runs to the door screaming "DAD!" and hugs my legs to pick him up.
