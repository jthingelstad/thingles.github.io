We've had the Vitamix for about three months now and a morning smoothie has become part of our routine now. We use the Vitamix for many other things as well, but most mornings it will be stacked like this.

We've learned that for us we like our smoothies to start with a base. Similar to soups starting with a [Mirepoix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirepoix_(cuisine)) ([onions](http://wikinosh.com/wiki/Onion), [carrots](http://wikinosh.com/wiki/Carrot) and [celery](http://wikinosh.com/wiki/Celery)), we start every smoothie with a [banana](http://wikinosh.com/wiki/Banana), [apple](http://wikinosh.com/wiki/Apple) and [carrot](http://wikinosh.com/wiki/Carrot). After that, it's always a good idea to heap a couple of cups of [spinach](http://wikinosh.com/wiki/Spinach). It's great to start the day with a healthy helping of greens. The smoothie above was had a number of frozen berries added on top; [blackberries](http://wikinosh.com/wiki/Blackberries), [strawberries](http://wikinosh.com/wiki/Strawberries), [blueberries](http://wikinosh.com/wiki/Blueberries) and [raspberries](http://wikinosh.com/wiki/Raspberries). I also love to put a bunch of [peaches](http://wikinosh.com/wiki/Peach) with other stuff.

I will typically splash a little almond milk in and pour a teaspoon or so of [chia seeds](http://wikinosh.com/wiki/Chia_Seeds,_trÅ«Roots). Sometimes a small dollop of [honey](http://wikinosh.com/wiki/Honey) as well, but avoid the honey to keep it [vegan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegan).

A few seconds later and I've got a delicious smoothie!

The only thing not great is that the green spinach and colorful berries tend to make a brown smoothie. But it tastes awesome!
