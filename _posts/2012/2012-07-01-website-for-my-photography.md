I've got a new website where I am highlighting my photography, **[Thingelstad Photography](http://photog.thingelstad.com/)**!
My photography hobby has grown over time and I wanted a place where I could share some of my favorite shots. I found that my [main blog](/) was a place for writing mostly and didn't highlight images really well. My new photography site is also built with WordPress but uses the excellent [AutoFocus 2.0 Pro](http://fthrwght.com/autofocus/) theme by [Allan Cole](http://allancole.com/). I really like how this theme puts the image front and center.

My plan with this site is to post an image a week, or more. The photos are not always current, I go back in my Lightroom archive as I wish for images. Sometimes revisiting a shot from a few years ago with fresh eyes is even more rewarding for me.

I invite you to check it out and feel free to leave some comments if the image moves you. You can alsoÂ [subscribe](http://photog.thingelstad.com/subscribe/) to get notified of updates.
