For years I've ran a guest WiFi network at home that has been called "Thingelstad Guest". It makes it super easy for people that are visiting to hop online when they are visiting. I also don't have to share the key for the "Thingelstad Home" network with people that are visiting which is a plus.
Last night my buddy [Ry4an Brase](http://ry4an.org) [posted on Google+](https://plus.google.com/u/0/102107327429602724512/posts/5icm8FJ5sZP?cfem=1) this EFF [Open Wireless project](https://openwireless.org). I'm a proponent of allowing unfettered access to the Internet so I decided to join up and rename our guest network.

Does your router support a guest network? How about [doing the same on your network](https://openwireless.org/join)?
