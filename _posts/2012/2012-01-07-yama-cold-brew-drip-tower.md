A few weeks ago I was discussing various ways of making coffee with [Ry4an](http://ry4an.org/) at the office. He had seen this crazy looking coffee system and sent me a [link for it](http://blacksmithcoffee.com/products/yama-6-8-cup-cold-brew-coffee-dripper). My instant response wasâ€¦
**Gorgeously Finicky!**

Tammy thought the one I sent her a link to was about the ugliest thing she had ever seen, but she found an acceptable looking Yama and got it for me for my birthday from Mazie and Tyler.

It takes **three hours** to brew **8 cups of coffee**. The resulting coffee is similar to cold press coffee, but with significantly more theater to the production. My first run didn't come out right. I tried to grind the beans myself and didn't get the right grind consistency and the water went through far too fast.

There is much written about ice brewed coffee. [CoffeeGeek has a good writeup](http://coffeegeek.com/guides/icedcoffee).
