We returned to [The Dakota](http://dakotacooks.com) last night after [seeing Robyn Hitchcock](/thingelstad/robyn-hitchcock-at-the-dakota) the night before for [The New Standards](http://www.thenewstandards.com).

We've seen The New Standards play at the Dakota at least six times before, and every time it's a treat. Last night we got to enjoy the show with our friends [Kent](http://thetangens.net) and Marilee celebrating Kent's birthday! That only made it even better. It was also great to hear that the new album is on the way, and by the sound of it the recording was done and it should be coming relatively soon. They seemed to be really on, playing extra well together and having a lot of fun. It was a great show. You really shouldn't pass up the opportunity to see them, especially at The Dakota.
