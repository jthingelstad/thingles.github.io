I've been an OmniFocus user since the very first release and use it all day, everyday on my Macs, iPhone and iPad. I've found it really useful to read blog posts from other OmniFocus users, and I know there are a number of people in the Twin Cities using OmniFocus.

I'm curious if there is enough interest to garner an OmniFocus meet up? The meet up would be very informal. An opportunity to connect with others using OmniFocus and share stuff that works for us. Project structures, contexts, perspectives and more. Leave a comment here if you would be very interested in attending an event like this.
