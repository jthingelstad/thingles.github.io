This morning Mazie, Tyler and I built a super fort in the living room! Here is the view from inside!

**It was awesome!**

We anchored it on the couch and then built support structures with [OGOBILD Kit Pod](https://www.ogosport.com/main/ogostore/ogobild-kit-pod) sets.  For Christmas Mazie got one of these sets from Grandma and Grandpa Olson. These things were as much a toy for me as them it seemed. The only problem with the kit? There was only 30 poles and 10 connectors. We couldn't build big enough.

So, on my 40th birthday I decided the kids each needed a present from me. Two OGOBILD Kit Pods later ([Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0048EKSLA/?tag=thingelstad-20)) and we were ready to build! We made some pretty big structures but always wanted to turn them into forts. Sheets weren't big enough, and they weighed too much. What to do?

**Parachute!**

Not just any parachute. A [20 foot parachute](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000Y0KIIA/?tag=thingelstad-20)! I thought about getting the 12 foot one but it seemed like it could be too small. A few days later and we got to build some huge stuff and wrap it in an awesome parachute. More fun than you can shake a stick at!

Honestly the parachute is too big for inside use, but it has plenty of room to make forts out of. Plus it is pretty light so it hangs way better than a sheet. It's still plenty durable for the kids and even Chase the dog. We had a great morning hanging out in the Super Fort.

Now we just need even more OGOBILD's to make bigger stuff! _Just kidding!_
