Friday night I had my friends Jim, Tom and Tim over for the first "movie night" in our new family room. I've been wanting to watch The Shining for a while, but Tammy wasn't interested [1. To be clear, Tammy has seen the Shining many times. She just didn't feel like watching again.]. I'm not much for watching any movie by myself, much less one of the most disturbing horror movies of all time.

The Shining has kept a firm place in my psyche for over two decades. I don't remember when I first saw it, but I do know that I was most likely far too young to see it. When I was a kid I had a ridiculously good imagination and if a room was dark, like when you go to sleep at night, I could see clearly whatever was in my head. The Grady twins were often in my head after seeing it.

It's still a fantastically freaky movie but now I can appreciate the cinematography and the delightful cadence of the dialogue. I don't know if there is any movie that has so many pauses in dialogue that just leave you hanging there. If your curious to learn more, the [Shining Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shining_(film)) is a good starter and then the essay [Hidden Meanings in the Shining](http://www.drummerman.net/shining/essays.html)Â by Bill Blakemore as well as [Mazes, Mirrors, Deception and Denial](http://www.collativelearning.com/the%20shining.html) by Rob Ager. Both of these leave you with a much deeper appreciation of everything going on in the movie.

If you haven't watched the Shining, or if it's been a while, read some of those essays and give it another watch. Details will pop out from everywhere, but you'll still be terrified. :-)
