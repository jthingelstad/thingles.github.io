I decided to try out [Duet Display](http://www.duetdisplay.com/) for the first time this weekend (based on a [post from MacSparky](http://macsparky.com/blog/2015/12/thumbs-up-for-duet-display)). I’m super impressed with it. I really like that it uses a Thunderbolt connection so doesn't require WiFi or something else I wouldn't trust. With the iPad Pro it gives you a lot of space. When I’m traveling and want to setup for some serious work being able to set the iPad Pro up as a 2nd display will be great.

Definitely work checking out if you have an iPad Pro or even iPad.
