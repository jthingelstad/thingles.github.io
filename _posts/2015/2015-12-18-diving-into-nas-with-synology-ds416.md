I've been debating my home storage options for a long time now. I've had a LaCie 4big Quadra RAID for many years now with 6TB usable space. It’s very old now, I can only use it with Firewire 800 which is quickly disappearing from the world. It recently failed a drive and I decided it was time to make an upgrade.

I've ben hesitant about SANs because of their added complexity, but the Synology gets rave reviews and has some pretty great capabilities. The drive will get here along with four 4TB WD "Red" NAS drives.
