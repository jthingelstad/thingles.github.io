I [ordered my Apple Watch](/thingelstad/apple-watch-ordered) on launch day and opted for the stainless steel with link bracelet. It was back ordered 4-6 weeks and yesterday it arrived. Yes, I was pretty excited to play with it!

The initial impression of it was great. I've worn a [Rolex GMT Master II](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolex_GMT_Master_II) for about 15 years. I opted for this Apple Watch because it was the most similar in look, weight and feel to that. The heft and feel of the Apple Watch holds every bit as much respect as the substantially more expensive Rolex. As something that feels good on my wrist and looks great it passes.

The rest of this experience is about software and that will take time to have opinions on. I’m going to note some of my hopes here to compare to in a future post.

  1. I hope to check my phone less.
  2. I’m very interested in the better health data.
  3. Eager to use OmniFocus on this; I’m a heavy user of this and having it on my wrist has great potential.
  4. Explore new experiences with apps and glances.

Will be fun to explore this new ecosystem.
