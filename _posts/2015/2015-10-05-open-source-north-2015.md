This weekend I was able to join what I expect will be the 1st annual [Open Source North](http://opensourcenorth.com)Â conference. I gave a talk on Using Open Source to Transform Your Organization. I wasn't able to stay for the entire day but the event was very well run, good lineup of speakers and very good attendance as well.

I'm hoping they plan to organize this again next year, I can definitely see this growing into a substantial event.
