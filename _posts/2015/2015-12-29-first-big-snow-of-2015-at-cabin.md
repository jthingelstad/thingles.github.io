We got a nice layer of snow over the last 24 hours at the cabin. We were all set at the cabin so we just had the fireplace going and hung around inside watching it get whiter and whiter outside.

Look close in this picture below and you can see a portable ice fishing house in the little dot in the middle of the lake.
