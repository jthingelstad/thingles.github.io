We [got rid of cable TV a long time ago]({{site.url}}{% link _posts/2009/2009-01-25-directv-canceled.md %}). Over 6 years ago actually, and technically we got rid of satellite TV. Every TV we have has an Apple TV attached to it and we still have one [OTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrestrial_television) [TiVo Roamio](https://www.tivo.com/shop/roamio#/roamio) we use to grab TV for free, the way nature intended it to be.

We do subscribe though to some services. I recently activated the 1-week free trial for HBO NOW. I’m impressed by the programming and it’s appealing to have access to the HBO original programming. We end up buying some of it in iTunes anyway. Maybe I'll finally catch the [Game of Thrones](http://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones) fever.

It feels like the "new" cable is forming.

**Netflix + Hulu + HBO NOW**

It’s not quiet the ala carte of show-by-show programming, but definitely a whole new world.

I find it notable that my kids can both pick out the Netflix anywhere, but they have no idea what NBC, CBS, ABC or FOX are.
