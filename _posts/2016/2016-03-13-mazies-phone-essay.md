We are talking to our daughter about getting her a phone for her birthday this year. She's not too excited about it, in fact, she decided to write a short essay to make her point.

> I don’t need a phone. I don’t want a phone. I don’t have a phone and I don’t want that to change. Electronics are irresistible eye widening, pass-time things that make your day fly away. Your fly away day is a day that you will have no memory/memories of the next month. Life would be ruined if I got a phone. It would be like my iPad, sit in the corner, collecting dust.

I love the "irresistible eye widening, pass-time things". There is more truth in here than we'd all like to think.
