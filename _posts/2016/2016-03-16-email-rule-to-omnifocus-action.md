title: Email Rule to OmniFocus Action
tags: OmniFocus GTD Email

I get a large volume of email and I try to find every tool I can to better manage it. There are a number of systems that notify me of actions I need to take via email. These clutter up my workflow and I never process these messages like email from people. For example, someone submits an expense report and I need to approve it so Concur sends me an email.

For emails that are *always* actions, I've found it nice to route them straight into my OmniFocus Inbox using a rule. The [Omni Sync service](https://manage.sync.omnigroup.com) has a Maildrop feature that will route from an email address directly to your OmniFocus Inbox.

I use a rule like the one above route these system emails around my email and then close them out in my task workflow in OmniFocus. Itâ€™s a great way to keep email clean and automatically get these next actions in my system.
