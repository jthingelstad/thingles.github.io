I downloaded [Vibe](https://github.com/tschoffelen/vibe) and gave it a run and got this fun display.

What a fun project to take the data from OmniFocus and give you some nice visuals. I’m not sure these are real actionable data points but it’s a fun start. It would be pretty amazing if OmniFocus had an API that 3rd parties could access to do some interesting visuals like this.
