I've been using [Pinboard][] to store bookmarks for years and have always been very happy with it. I've got over 8,000 bookmarks in Pinboard and routinely send links into it nearly every day.

Pinboard is a super fast website, but I've wanted a solid Mac application to use with it as well. I had tried [Thumbtack][] but it just never really worked for me. It is probably great for others. When I was reading [Brett Terpstra's 2015 Top Mac Apps](http://brettterpstra.com/2016/02/17/a-look-back-at-2015-my-top-mac-apps/) he linked to [Spillo][] as his preferred Pinboard client. Brett knows his stuff so [I pinned Spillo](https://pinboard.in/u:thingles/b:eb2678454652) and decided to check it out.

First off Spillo has a very comfortable UI. It reminds me of an RSS reader or email application with a simple 3-column layout. It provides the key Pinboard views of your own bookmarks (all, unread, untagged, starred, etc) and also includes the Community features of Pinboard like Network and Popular. I’m a big fan of [Pinboard's Popular](https://pinboard.in/popular/) list. That is where I discover most new things.

Spillo also adds Collections which are search based and can include any criteria like tag, unread status even where the link came from. I like this since I have a workflow around videos from conferences that I want to watch. I don't think of those as normal unread items since they take a lot more time. So I have a "Videos to watch" collection that brings these together real nice.

Overall I really like Spillo and I’m hopeful that the developer behind it is going to continue to extend it. I like that the focus is on a Mac client and there isn't a plan for Spillo for iOS. I already use [Pinner](http://pinnerapp.net) for Pinboard on my iPhone and it works great. Also, if you are not using [Pinboard][] and you routinely like to bookmark things you should give it a look.
