Some friends sent me this video from a European Pro RC Race. Itâ€™s the most amazing thing ever! Worth a watch. Check out the speed, the passes and the jumps!

So much more they could be doing!

  1. Where is the real-time telemetry for each car? I want to see scaled MPH for each car.
  2. I'd love to see the G's that they are taking on the turns. It seems like a guarantee that these cars are taking turns in a way that no human could actually do.
  3. Where is the POV video from each car?! Must have streaming video from each car, imagine the POV shot when the aerial pass happens?

This would be even more fun, and those are just the immediate ideas that come to mind!
