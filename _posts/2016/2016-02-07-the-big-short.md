We saw [The Big Short][imdb] last night and I was simply blown away. Parts of it hilarious, suspenseful, gripping. It had me hooked all the way through. As a story on **what really happened** it’s also terrifying. See it for some amazing acting, or great cinematography or just for a night at the movies. But take some time as well to just think about what you saw and how much of it is real.
