We've crossed a big milestone this year. As of this birthday Mazie now has her very own iPad. No more sharing. It is also setup with her own accounts for email and calendaring. She's a digital equal in the house now.
Mazie was ecstatic about it and has been having fun using it for a variety of things. Iâ€™m really hoping that she uses email and messages. She's been playing a couple of games. She even was reviewing her calendar to see what was coming up this week. Nice!

Of course the immediate reaction from Tyler was to wonder where his is. Wait a couple years there.
