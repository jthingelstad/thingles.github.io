title: Getting started with Ansible

I've been planning to start working on using a [configuration management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_management) solution for my hobby servers. [Chef](http://www.getchef.com) was too heavy for my purposes, and confused me a lot. I got really enamored with [SaltStack](http://www.saltstack.com), but never really caught onto it. I decided to give [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/home) a go and actually have a couple of hosts in [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com) and am managing some limited packages with Ansible. My [work is in GitHub](https://github.com/thingles/ansible).

In theory, it should be straightforward to take [my build notes](http://wiki.thingelstad.com/wiki/Pub2_build_notes) and turn them into Ansible playbooks. We'll see.
