Tammy and I went to see [Whiplash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whiplash_(2014_film)) last night at the renovated [Uptown Theater](http://www.landmarktheatres.com/market/Minneapolis/UptownTheatre.htm) [1. The couch seating is unique, comfortable and nice, but could use more leg room.]. Really good film about the ridiculous effort that must be put in to be _great_ at something, in this case music.  In addition to the storyline your treated to wonderful music and some stunning drumming on screen. Purchased [the soundtrack](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/whiplash-original-motion-picture-soundtrack/id918264571?uo=4&app=itunes&at=1001lxyE&ct=thingelstad_com) on the way out of the theater.
