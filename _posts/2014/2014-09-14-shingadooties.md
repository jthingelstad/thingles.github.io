<blockquote>For years Mazie has been using this word that she made up. She decided that it meant "everything". Quite specifically, everything. Any question she asked, if you answered with "shingadooties" it would be right. This wonderful word has [no representation on the Internet](http://google.com/search?q=shingadooties) so Mazie and I decided to fix that by defining it here. So a shingadooties this shingadooties post about shingadooties.
