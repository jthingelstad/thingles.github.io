I got [Blokus](http://www.mattelgames.com/en-us/blokus/index.html) ([Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FBWBM3G/?tag=thingelstad-20)) for Christmas in the brother-in-law swap on the Olson side (thanks Max!). It’s a really fun game. Ultimately best suited for 4 players with a graceful way to play with 2 players. 3 players works but its not a great fit. The strategy of the game is to block other opponents off as they try to lay tiles down on the board. While [Go](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)) players would probably cringe at the comparison it seems loosely related.
