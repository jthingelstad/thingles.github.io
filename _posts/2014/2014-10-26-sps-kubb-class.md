[Garrick](https://garrickvanburen.com) and I joined forcesÂ and auctioned off a Kubb Class at the annual [SPS](http://www.spscommerce.com) Charity Auction this year. The sales engineering team won the event and we got 12 of them together this past week for a tournament level Kubb class. It was an awesome time with a ton of great questions on the game and a jump-start into Kubb strategy and technique.
