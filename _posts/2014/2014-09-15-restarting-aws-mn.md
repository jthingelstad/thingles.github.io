A couple of months ago [Bridget Kromhout](http://bridgetkromhout.com) and I started talking about coordinating with the [Twin Cities Amazon Web Services User Group](http://www.meetup.com/Twin-Cities-Amazon-Web-Services-User-Group) organizers to get the meetup group going again. The first thing we did was change the name to something a bit shorter, [AWS MN](http://aws.mn/wiki/Home).
We had our first meetup a month ago to get things going again with a pretty loose agenda. This Wednesday we have a presentation I’m _super_ excited about on [Automating AWS with Ansible](http://aws.mn/wiki/Automating_AWS_with_Ansible) by [David Federlein](https://twitter.com/dfed). We already have presentations for October and December as well. Want to present for November? `:-)`

This is my first time organizing a meetup and I’m super excited to be doing this with Bridget who is frankly **awesome** at all of this (you should follow her on Twitter, [@bridgetkromhout](https://twitter.com/bridgetkromhout)). We are also [using GitHub issues](https://github.com/thingles/aws_mn/issues) to coordinate our work which is working really well and hosting at [SPS Commerce](http://www.spscommerce.com) using our training facility which also works fabulous for this and is nicely located in core downtown.

If you have an interest in AWS and topics related to it, you should definitely join the meetup and come to our sessions. They are the third Wednesday of every month at 6pm! Also follow [@aws_mn](https://twitter.com/aws_mn) on Twitter!
