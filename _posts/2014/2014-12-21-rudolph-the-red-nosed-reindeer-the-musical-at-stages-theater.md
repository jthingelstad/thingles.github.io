Today we went and saw [Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer: The Musical](http://www.stagestheatre.org/upcoming-shows/02/19/2014/rudolph-red-nosed-reindeer-musical) at the Stages Theater in Hopkins. It was a really great show, the best production we've seen there. I highly recommend catching it before it ends on Jan 3. The kids loved it and the costumes were great too.
