I've been running a [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki) [farm at thingelstad.com](https://wikiapiary.com/wiki/Farm:Thingelstad.com) for a couple of years now hosting about a dozen wikis ranging from small to very large. Running a MediaWiki farm is a bit complicated and you can approach it a number of different ways. I recently [pushed the settings that I use to run my farm into GitHub](https://github.com/thingles/wiki-farm) so others can see how I do it. The next step will be to also move the scripts that I use up, but those will be kept in another repository.

Hopefully this proves useful to others. Itâ€™s useful for me to finally have these very complicated settings (really code!) under version control.
