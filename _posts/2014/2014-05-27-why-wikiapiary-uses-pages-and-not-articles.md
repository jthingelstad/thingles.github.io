A while back @Waldyrious posed this question about [WikiApiary](https://wikiapiary.com/wiki/Main_Page).

The full answer is actually found [in my talk page on WikiApiary](https://wikiapiary.com/wiki/User_talk:Thingles/Up_to_January_2013#Articles). Articles are a construct that each wiki can manage. MediaWiki tries to create these two classes of content: Pages and Articles. The intent being that pages are in some way less like "content" than articles. The metrics for determining this are configurable, but Iâ€™m guessing nearly everyone leaves it at the defaults. I felt that the page concept, just looking at content and not judging if it was better or worse was a simpler way to look at thousands of different wikis.
