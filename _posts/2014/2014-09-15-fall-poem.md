Mazie had a homework assignment for fall poetry that involved having your parents write a poem and copying it in her notebook. Here is my poem.


The leaves had all gone
from the trees.

In the air
there was a gentle breeze.

My nose could smell
the freshness in the air.

The air isÂ chilly
and the weather is fair.

The days are getting shorter
the harvest moon is tall.

This is my favorite season
I love the fall.
