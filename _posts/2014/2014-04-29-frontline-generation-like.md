Tammy and I watched this [Frontline: Generation Like](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/generation-like/)Â tonight. If you are at all curious about how the social media ecosystem works, where the revenue is, what the motivation behind the users is check this out. Very well done episode with a lot of insight.

So much of what happens in this social ecosystem seems like bubble gum. It always leaves me wondering what impact would it have if this effort went to doing something worthwhile, instead of selling tickets to movies.
