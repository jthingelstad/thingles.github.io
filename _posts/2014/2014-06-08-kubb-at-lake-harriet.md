Most of the time when I see people playing [Kubb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubb) around Minneapolis they are folks I know from [Minnesota Kubb](http://minnesotakubb.com). It was fun today to stop on a bike ride around [Lake Harriet](http://www.minneapolisparks.org/?PageID=4&parkid=266) and right by the bandshell were 6 womenÂ having a nice game of Kubb. They were playing with a [Bex set](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0006A3LWS/?tag=thingelstad-20), the pitch was a bit small and they were doing that weird thing where you stack field kubbs on top of each other. But, they were having a blast throwing wood!
