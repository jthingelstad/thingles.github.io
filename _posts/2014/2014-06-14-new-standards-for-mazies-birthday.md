This year [The New Standards](http://www.thenewstandards.com) did one of their great shows at [The Dakota](http://www.dakotacooks.com) right on Mazie's birthday! At first we figured we would just not go see them, but we asked Mazie if she would want to go out for a grown-up night and she was all for it! We got one of the great U-shaped tables along the edge and Mazie got to sit right in the middle and enjoy a [Shirley Temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirley_Temple_(cocktail)) and cheeseburger while listening to great music.

I sent an email to the band letting them know a 9 year old was celebrating her birthday with them and [Chan](http://www.chanpoling.com/) gave a nice call out to her. It was a super fun evening.
