I helped my Uncle Tim get a new website up and running for [Bike the Border](http://biketheborder.com), a bike ride in North Dakota that he has started running. Â Another case where WordPress was able to deliver a really great CMS. In return, he set me up with this really nice jersey.
He's going to be in the Twin Cities on July 4th and is going to join us for the [Twin Cities Bicycling Club](http://www.biketcbc.org/) [Watermelon Ride](http://www.biketcbc.org/joomla/index.php/26-events/138-watermelon-ride). We are going to be sporting our matching jerseys! Thanks Uncle Tim!
