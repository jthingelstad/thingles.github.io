If you login to Twitter and go to your Direct Messages you press a button to mark all as read, and then you have to confirm. I don't think I've ever seen a "Mark all as read" button that looks so foreboding.
![dont dare mark all as read]({{ site.url }}{% link /assets/posts/2014/dont-dare-mark-all-as-read.png %})

That looks like a "Watch out what you push because everything will be deleted" red button that you need to be very, very careful with. Â Terrible for this function.
