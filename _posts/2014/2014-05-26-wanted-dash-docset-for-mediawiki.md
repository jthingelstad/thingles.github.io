I really wish there were a [Dash](http://kapeli.com/dash) Docset for MediaWiki. The [directions for creating docsets](http://kapeli.com/docsets) are pretty straightforward. It also strikes me that using [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) to do wikitext to html you could convert [existing help pages](http://m.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Contents) into HTML and make the Docset.

Maybe someone else will read this and think it is a great idea and do it.
