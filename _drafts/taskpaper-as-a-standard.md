There should be a way for people to share tasks with other people. Iâ€™m not talking about a fancy team collaboration system, but instead just a way for one person who has a great set of tasks that they follow around an event or occasion to share that with other people that may get value out of it. Recent changes have started to show that the Taskpaper format may be just that.

```taskpaper
- Do daily review @parallel(true) @autodone(true) @context(Computer) @defer(2016-10-17 06:00) @repeat-method(fixed) @repeat-rule(FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO,TU,WE,TH,FR)
	- Create meeting templates @estimate(2m) @context(iPhone)
	- Scan calendar for the day @estimate(5m) @context(Office : Computer)
	- Review incoming meeting requests @estimate(3m) @context(Computer)
```
