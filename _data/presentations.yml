  description: "The push for free online services and apps have given rise to an ecosystem of organizations that track, cross-reference, compile, and then resell you to advertisers.

  - The federal government and the California state government are debating new privacy bills that would limit the collection and sharing of customer information.
  - The FTC called for a Do Not Track system similar to the Do Not Call system for telemarketers.
  - Microsoft, Apple, and Firefox have all added 'Do Not Track' functionality to the next version of their browsers.

In this session we'll discuss the issue of online privacy, customer information collection, tracking, and then demo some solutions.

Bug Image is from [Do Not Track](http://donottrack.us/)."

- title: Wikis with Structured Data

  description: "A wiki is an incredibly useful way to create document-centric websites, but if you are working with a structured data and want to run queries across that data, a wiki can result in chaos. With the right tools though, a wiki can be incredibly useful for both structured and unstructured data.
In this session we'll cover using [MediaWiki](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki) and the powerful [Semantic Bundle](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Semantic_Bundle) to create data rich wikis with very structured data. To demonstrate this we will create new templates, properties and forms using MediaWiki and Semantic Bundle. We'll also look at advanced examples of these tools using three wikis I setup and help run, [Creative Computer Book Club](http://creativecomputerbookclub.com/wiki/), [Road Sign Math](http://www.roadsignmath.com/wiki/Welcome) and [TOS Redux](http://tosredux.com/wiki/Main_Page).
This session will be beneficial to anyone looking to create useful sites using MediaWiki. To illustrate these concepts we will build a structured wiki for Minnebar."

And most of us know the difference between a 301 and a 302. But there are over 65 HTTP status codes! We live eat and breath the web and we had better know what these status codes mean!

In this session we will *quickly* go over **every** HTTP status code, what it is for, why you use it, etc. This will be part informational and part theater as we try to make it through each one in the 45 minutes allotted us!

**Be on time!**"

In this session I'll walk through a 'best practices' taking a bare Unix box to running a handful of web sites. I'll use Ubuntu 10.04 LTS as the example case with a VPS on Linode. The material will be generally applicable to anyone using a Linux/Unix based host and needing to make sure that it is sound for service."

In this session we will explore advanced techniques for running MediaWiki, extending it's capabilities with amazing extensions, and building ridiculously advanced websites with it. We will use [WikiApiary](http://wikiapiary.com/), a wiki I built, as an example of using a semantic data-driven wiki, robots to collect data and integrating a variety of libraries together into a cohesive solution. You'll leave with a better understanding of the robust power of this software stack, and excitement to go and build crazy stuff with it!"
